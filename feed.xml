What began as an internal newsletter has grown into a dynamic publication that celebrates everything that makes Atlantic City an extraordinary place to live, work, and thrive.</p><p id="">The rebrand comes at an exciting time, aligning with the launch of the Great Day Atlantic City app—a digital platform designed to shine a light on the people, progress, and positive news happening across the city. Together, the Gazette and the app form a powerful communication hub, keeping residents, employees, and visitors informed about all the great things taking place within Atlantic City.</p><p id="">In his opening message, Mayor Marty Small Sr. expressed enthusiasm for the Gazette’s evolution and the city’s renewed focus on positivity and transparency. “There are way too many negative voices out there when it comes to the Great City of Atlantic City,” the Mayor said. “The Great Day platform gives all the positives, which far outweigh the negatives—the spotlight they deserve.”</p><p id="">This month’s issue of the Great Day Gazette is packed with inspiring stories, community highlights, and exciting updates. Readers can look back on the success of <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com/news/positive-culture-shift-for-atlantic-city-employees-continues-with-mayor-smalls-great-day-event" id=""><strong id="">Great Day 2025</strong></a>, a day of motivation and team building for city employees dedicated to the memory of Chief of Staff Ernest Coursey. The event featured keynote speaker Nehemiah Davis, who encouraged city staff to focus on growth, resilience, and becoming the best versions of themselves.</p><p id="">The Gazette also covers the city’s presence at the first Atlantic City Strategic Communications Summit, hosted by Stockton University and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA). There, the city’s Marketing Team—including Public Information Officer Andrew Kramer, Assistant PIO Adele Polk, Shennita Williams, and Ziggy Chau of Lucky PR—presented Great Day Atlantic City as a leading example of civic storytelling and community engagement. The summit emphasized collaboration and shared messaging across local institutions to build a stronger, unified voice for Atlantic City.</p><p id="">Readers will also find updates on major development and infrastructure projects. Mayor Small joined community leaders for the grand opening of The Seahaus Hotel and Cucina Del Mar, celebrating the continued growth of Atlantic City’s hospitality sector. Meanwhile, the city began the long-anticipated revitalization of Atlantic Avenue—a transformative project that includes new paving, traffic signal upgrades, ADA-compliant ramps, enhanced lighting, and beautification improvements designed to make the corridor safer and more welcoming for all.</p><p id="">Economic opportunity and small business growth are also front and center. The Gazette highlights the Small Business Micro Grant Program, providing reimbursement support for local businesses through federal ARPA funding, and the new food truck program opening two prime locations—Gardner’s Basin and O’Donnell Memorial Park—to bring affordable dining options and entrepreneurial opportunities to the community.</p><p id="">In Public Safety News, the friendly rivalry between the Atlantic City Fire Department and Police Department took center stage during the first-ever Mayor’s Cup Softball Game. The community gathered at Pop Lloyd Stadium to cheer on both teams, celebrating camaraderie and civic pride. The issue also recognized newly promoted fire officers and honored the city’s first responders during the Atlantic City 9/11 Memorial Ceremony.</p><p id="">The Gazette continued its tradition of celebrating people and programs that make Atlantic City vibrant—from Senior Appreciation Day and Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations at City Hall, to new youth initiatives including the Youth Theater Program, Girl Scouts sessions, and Little Leapers gymnastics. Each story reflected the city’s ongoing mission to create inclusive, engaging opportunities for all residents—young and old alike.</p><p id="">Looking ahead, the issue also shared details on upcoming events that embody the city’s community spirit, including the Flood Safety Workshop, the Roll Out! Skating Party for National Coming Out Day, the Drive-In Movie &amp; S’mores Night at Bader Field, and the much-anticipated Harvest Town Festival at Gardner’s Basin.</p><p id="">As the city continues to evolve, the Great Day Gazette stands as a symbol of connection and collaboration—highlighting the stories that too often go untold and celebrating the everyday efforts that make Atlantic City stronger. Whether it’s infrastructure progress, employee recognition, or community celebration, the Gazette captures it all.</p><p id="">Mayor Small summed it up best: “No other administration in Atlantic City history has given employees the amount of training, recognition, and opportunity they’re getting right now—and that’s something I’ll never let up on.”</p><p id="">Read the full October 2025 issue of the Great Day Gazette to stay informed, inspired, and connected to the city’s latest achievements and upcoming events. Because here in Atlantic City—every day truly is a Great Day.</p><p id="">‍</p><h5 id=""><strong id="">To view the full version of October 2025 Great Day Gazette, click here:</strong> <a href="https://www.acnj.gov/_Content/pdf/Great-Day-Gazette-October-2025.pdf">View the newsletter</a>‍</h5>

<description><![CDATA[The annual 'Great Day' event is Mayor Small's signature initiative to strengthen workforce climate and culture, boost morale, and unite City of Atlantic City employees as one team.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small, Sr. has long said that to truly build Atlantic City, the transformation must begin from the inside out. Since becoming mayor in October 2019, he’s turned that vision into action, reshaping the culture of City Hall and setting a new standard for local government. From his first days in office, Mayor Small raised expectations for every department and made accountability a cornerstone of his administration. He’s expanded opportunities for advancement through internal mobility, promotions, and well-earned raises, ensuring that dedicated employees see a future in public service. Just as importantly, he has invested heavily in training programs that give staff unprecedented professional development and the skills needed to better serve Atlantic City taxpayers.</p><p id="">That commitment came into full focus at this year’s <strong id="">Great Day 2025</strong> event held at the Showboat Resort for a third straight year. This is the mayor’s signature initiative to strengthen workforce climate and culture, boost morale, and unite City of Atlantic City employees as one team. It’s the only time each year every city worker gathers under one roof outside city buildings to receive key organizational updates directly from the mayor and gain fresh perspective from nationally recognized outside sources.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab55fbfa7c8670733811c_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_160.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small and guest speaker Nehemiah Davis during Great Day 2025 at Showboat Resort (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">This year’s motivational speaker was philanthropist Nehemiah Davis, who shared his inspiring journey from humble beginnings in Philadelphia—where he frequently found himself getting into trouble—to becoming a prominent figure dedicated to helping others transform their lives. Addressing City of Atlantic City employees, Davis encouraged them to write down the affirmation: “I’m committed and focused on making this the best year ever.” He emphasized how mindset shifts can lead to real change and challenged staff to stop saying, “I have to go to work,” and instead embrace the privilege of being able to say, “I get to go to work”— especially in a place like Atlantic City.</p><p id="">Great Day 2025 carried added significance this year, as it was held in memory of the late Chief of Staff Ernest Coursey. Known for his unwavering dedication as a public servant and his deep care for city employees, Coursey left a lasting legacy. In his honor, all staff wore commemorative shirts, and the city announced the upcoming launch of the Coursey Cares Health&amp; Wellness Challenge, an initiative aimed at promoting small, sustainable lifestyle changes that employees can carry with them for life.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:4817px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="4817px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab5d59d961afd2648ce17_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_15.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">The City of Atlantic City Health &amp; Human Serivces Department, CDBG Office and Public Information Office share details of the Coursey Cares Challenge during Great Day 2025 (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">Following the professional development portion of the day, employees get to relax and connect at Showboat’s Island Waterpark, and this year was no exception. With more than 700 employees spread across City Hall, the Public Safety Building, the Public Works Yard, and other locations, some staff members rarely cross paths, if ever. But on this one day a year, in the open, informal setting of the waterpark, colleagues can interact, bond, and build stronger relationships. Team building is a cornerstone of the Small Administration. It’s why each department is tasked with organizing its own annual retreat outside the Great Day event, and why Mayor Small personally leads a retreat for his directors. </p><p id="">A recent article from <em id="">The Press of Atlantic City</em> covering Great Day 2025 failed to spotlight the most critical component of the event, which is Mayor Small’s mission to raise expectations, invest in employee development, and celebrate the city's workforce. Mayor Small is demonstrating that a city government can evolve from within—and Great Day 2025 is a shining example of that transformation. His message is clear: when the workforce is motivated, well-trained, and connected, the entire Atlantic City community reaps the rewards.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab6a89f3e7cc7d1e0d652_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_96.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">City staff getting to unwind at Island Waterpark at the conclusion of Great Day 2025 (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure>

]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In <strong id="">Atlantic City</strong>, progress is not just measured in buildings or investments — it is reflected in the success of the small businesses that form the city’s backbone. Through its Keep It Local campaign, led by the Economic Development division under the Planning &amp; Development Department, the City of Atlantic City recognized the vital role that local entrepreneurs play in shaping the community’s future.</p><p id="">One highlight of this effort was the presentation of the Economic Growth &amp; Development Award to Kelsey’s Atlantic City, a local restaurant that has become a cultural landmark. For years, owners Kelsey and Kimberly Jackson worked tirelessly to serve not only food, but also hospitality that felt like home.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1790px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1790px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da883d99c301bd857fd2cb_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20212304.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">From its very beginning,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/kelseysatlanticcity" id=""> <strong id="">Kelsey’s</strong></a> was more than a place to eat. It was a gathering space where neighbors could share southern comfort meals, enjoy live music, and feel connected. It showed how a business could grow into a community institution, weaving itself into the everyday life of Atlantic City.</p><p id="">With three locations across the city, Kelsey’s also became a driver of local economic activity. By welcoming both residents and visitors, it drew people into neighborhoods, fueled local spending, and created job opportunities. In doing so, it embodied the spirit of growth and resilience that defines Atlantic City.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1350px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1350px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da86d77a2c0bf32080aaa1_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20211530.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The recognition of Kelsey’s demonstrated how local businesses reflect the larger momentum happening in the city. As Atlantic City invested in its neighborhoods, public spaces, and small enterprises, the success stories of people like the Jackson family became proof that the city’s vision of renewal was not only possible but already taking shape.</p><p id="">Receiving the award was described by Kelsey Jackson as “an honor and a privilege.” He emphasized that the acknowledgment was a testament to the dedication and effort put into the business over the years. Kimberly Jackson added that Atlantic City itself was “doing better than ever,” reflecting the citywide growth happening all around them.</p><p id="">Stories like Kelsey’s show why Atlantic City is more than a place to visit — it is a city to believe in. It is a place where hard work is recognized, where local culture thrives, and where economic development goes hand in hand with community spirit.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1426px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1426px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da86eff6932921eb1f8a71_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20211508.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">This recognition stood as a reminder that Atlantic City is not only a destination for entertainment but also a community where people can put down roots, build businesses, and create lasting impact. It is a city where individuals can find opportunity, connection, and pride.</p><p id="">Every award, every campaign, and every small business success adds to a bigger story — a story of a city moving forward together. Atlantic City is not just about what it offers to visitors; it is about what it provides to its own residents: a place to live, to work, and to grow.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">When Sophia Mammucari tells young people in Atlantic City, <em id="">“This city doesn’t limit you,”</em> she’s not just offering encouragement—she’s living proof of what’s possible.</p><p id="">Now a sophomore at Harvard University, Mammucari’s journey began in the heart of Atlantic City. Despite moving frequently during her early years, her family ultimately made Atlantic City home. It was there, as a student at Atlantic City High School, that she began to dream big and build the foundation that would carry her all the way to the Ivy League.</p><p id="">“Getting into Harvard was the best day of my life,” she said.</p><p id="">Mammucari is not only thriving academically, but she’s also giving back to the city that raised her. This summer, she returned home to intern with the City of Atlantic City Mayor’s Office and Business Administration Office, where she gained firsthand experience in how municipal government functions.</p><p id="">“I just wanted to learn how government works,” she explained. “I saw the full process, and it was full circle. My journey ended with the City Council meeting, so I saw how ordinances were written, how issues were addressed, all of the meetings that go into it, all the planning, and how there isn’t always a simple answer to everything. The Business Administrator (Anthony Swan) and Mayor (Small) really do work to address all concerns that come to City Hall.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68c826f2c143c131d2eb8f3e_Sophia%20Storm.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">As part of her summer internship with the City of Atlantic City, Sophia Mammucari got to take part in one of Mayor Small's news conferences. </figcaption></figure><p id="">Through programs like CitiStat, which allows residents to report and track issues through data-driven governance, Mammucari got to see how committed the city is to its own revitalization.</p><p id="">“I was impressed by how much work is being done to improve Atlantic City and to create a real renaissance,” she added.</p><p id="">Mammucari’s connection to the Small administration runs deeper than her internship. She is also a previous recipient of the <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com/department-stories/from-dream-to-degree-atlantic-citys-3m-scholarship-fund-is-changing-lives" id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship</a>, three-year, $3 million initiative supporting Atlantic City students in their pursuit of higher education.</p><p id="">“The scholarships helped me with my expenses during college and made it possible to go to Harvard and excel there,” she said.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:3791px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="3791px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68c82812c8908ded144f07dc_96-AC%20Scholarship%202024%20637.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Sophia Mammucari is a former 'Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship' recipient.</figcaption></figure><p id="">While she’s currently making her mark in Boston, Mammucari hasn’t forgotten where she came from. She hopes to one day return to Atlantic City and introduce her organization, <a href="https://www.thehigheredvantage.org/" target="_blank" id=""><strong id=""><em id="">The Higher EDvantage</em></strong></a>, to local students. The nonprofit offers guidance and support for those pursuing college or another form of higher education.</p><p id="">And her ambitions don’t stop there. Could “Mayor Mammucari” be in the city’s future?</p><p id="">“I don’t want to take Mayor Small’s job,” she said with a smile. “But maybe when he retires, I’d love to run for a government position.”</p><p id="">For now, Mammucari remains focused on her education—and on serving as a role model for the next generation of Atlantic City youth.</p><p id="">“I hope I can be someone local students look up to,” she said. “I always encourage kids—especially those from low-income backgrounds or who go to Atlantic City High School—to dream big. You may not think you’re capable, but the answer is always going to be no if you don’t try.”</p><p id="">If anyone ever doubts her hometown or says something negative about it, Mammucari is ready to set the record straight! And she now has the inside experience to back her stance and looks forward to sharing with the world why she is proud to be from Atlantic City and just how much potential this city truly has.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">PHOTOS BY <strong id="">EDWARD LEA / CITY OF ATLANTIC CITY</strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In Atlantic City, community is more than just a word — it’s a way of life. Through the Keep It Local campaign, led by the City of Atlantic City’s Economic Development division under the Planning &amp; Development Department, small businesses were celebrated for the essential role they played in shaping the city’s identity and strengthening its neighborhoods.</p><p id="">At the heart of this recognition stood a true local treasure: The Irish Pub Atlantic City, recipient of the Community Spirit Award.</p><p id="">A Legacy of Hospitality<br>With roots dating back to the 19th century, Richard and Cathy Burke founded The Irish Pub in 1972. Since then, it grew into more than just a dining spot. It became a local landmark, a piece of living history, and a gathering place where generations of residents and visitors alike came together for food, conversation, and friendship. From corned beef sandwiches to pints of beer, every visit carried with it the warmth of a second home.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1208px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1208px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68bb106e93caaa139a96f4e6_Screenshot%202025-09-06%20001641.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">The Irish Pub Owner - Cathy Burke</figcaption></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Standing the Test of Time</strong><br>Through decades of change, The Irish Pub remained a steady presence, a cornerstone that reflected the resilience and hospitality of Atlantic City itself. Tourists may have come for the boardwalk, beaches, or casinos, but locals knew there was always a seat waiting for them at the pub — a place to feel welcome and connected.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Community Rooted in Pride</strong><br>For Cathy Burke, the recognition was deeply meaningful. “We are such a supportive community of each other,” she shared. “It’s wonderful when you can have a community you love, you support and you’re appreciative to be in a city as beautiful as Atlantic City.”</p><p id="">Her words reflected not just the spirit of The Irish Pub, but the broader truth about why Atlantic City continues to be a city in motion: its strength lies in its people and their dedication to each other.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1841px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1841px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68bb10b3e0e16ed942145343_Screenshot%202025-09-06%20003206.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Why Atlantic City?</strong><br>Moments like these highlight why Atlantic City is more than a destination, it is a great community to live, to work, and to thrive. From local businesses that anchor neighborhoods, to city-led initiatives that honor and uplift them, Atlantic City is writing a story where tradition and progress go hand in hand.</p><p id=""><strong>Looking Ahead<br></strong>The Community Spirit Award was not just about honoring one business. It was about recognizing what makes Atlantic City special: its resilience, its pride, and its commitment to supporting local voices that carry the city’s culture forward.</p><p id="">As Atlantic City continues to grow and evolve, it is places like The Irish Pub — and the countless small businesses like it — that remind everyone why community matters, and why Atlantic City remains a city where opportunity, history, and heart all come together.</p>

<p id=""><strong id="">A Celebration of Resilience in Atlantic City</strong></p><p id="">In Atlantic City, resilience isn’t just a quality, it’s a way of life. Through the <strong id="">Keep It Local</strong> campaign, the <strong id="">City of Atlantic City</strong> shined a spotlight on the small businesses that have long served as the backbone of the community. More than storefronts, these businesses represent history, tradition, and the enduring spirit of a city that thrives through connection.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Honoring Generations of Service</strong><br>At the heart of this recognition stood <strong id="">Barbera Seafood Market</strong>, recipient of the <strong id="">Resiliency Award</strong>. A fixture in the Ducktown neighborhood for over a century, Barbera Seafood Market had not only served the freshest seafood in the region but also stood as a symbol of stability and pride for Atlantic City residents.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1818px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1818px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68b59e6177074febd66b2a0b_Screenshot%202025-09-01%20211156.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Since the 1980s, under the ownership of <strong id="">Dominic Alcaro</strong>, Barbera had carried forward its legacy with unbeatable prices, friendly service, and an unwavering presence in the community. Generations of families made it part of their routines — some stopping by daily — finding in Barbera not just a meal, but a piece of Atlantic City tradition.</p><p id=""><strong id="">More Than Recognition</strong><br>For Alcaro, the award was never the goal. His focus remained on giving back to the community that had supported the market for decades. “All I wanted to do was keep doing good things for the city,” he shared. “It made me glow a little bit, it made me feel good to know the people appreciated what we were doing for them.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1690px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1690px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68b59e703fed91e7976bfb1c_Screenshot%202025-09-01%20211231.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Why Atlantic City Is a Great Community</strong><br>The story of Barbera Seafood Market reflects the heart of Atlantic City itself.

The recognition of Barbera through the <strong id="">Resiliency Award</strong> was a reminder that Atlantic City’s strength lies in its people: entrepreneurs, families, and generations who continue to shape the city’s identity.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Place to Live and Work</strong><br>Atlantic City is more than a destination; it is a community where tradition meets opportunity. From long-standing businesses like Barbera to new ventures opening their doors, the city is filled with spaces that foster both connection and growth. It is a place to build a career, to raise a family, and to experience the richness of a community rooted in history yet always looking forward.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A City Moving Forward</strong><br>Through campaigns like <strong id="">Keep It Local</strong>, the City of Atlantic City reaffirmed its commitment to honoring the businesses that keep the community strong. By celebrating resilience and encouraging residents to support local, Atlantic City showed once again that it is not just a place to visit — it is a place to live, to work, and to thrive.</p><p id="">‍</p><h4 id=""><strong id="">#InvestinAC #LiveInAC #WorkInAC</strong></h4>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City made history with the launch of its first-ever <strong id="">Black Business Expo</strong>, a dynamic celebration of entrepreneurship and community collaboration. Held at the historic All Wars Memorial Building on August 26, 2025, the expo brought together Black-owned business vendors, local officials, and residents in honor of <strong id=""><em id="">National Black Business Month</em></strong>. The event served as a platform for local entrepreneurs to showcase their goods and services, gain exposure, and access vital resources designed to help their businesses grow.</p><p id="">Among the enthusiastic vendors was Ruschele Whitfield, owner of <em id="">Fitness Foodies</em>, a health-focused brand that promotes wellness through nutritious snacks and products.</p><p id="">“I’m grateful that the city arranged such a meaningful event for all entrepreneurs, especially Black entrepreneurs,” Whitfield said. “Small business ownership is not easy. So when you have a chance to elevate your business, you need community and motivation. We’re all excited to buy, sell, and learn here.”</p><p id="">The expo featured panel discussions with both emerging and established business leaders, live radiobroadcasts promoting local brands, and a curated art exhibit led by Atlantic City historian Ralph Hunter. In addition, attendees had the opportunity to apply for micro-grants aimed at supporting business development.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width=""><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68af6501709841fdaf511f0b_Black%20Expo_7.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Attendees getting to shop around and support Black businesses set up as vendors</figcaption></figure><p id="">For vendors like Samantha Prescott, founder of <em id="">Nana’s Pudding</em>, the experience was about more than just sales.</p><p id="">“This is a great marketing and networking event,” Prescott said. “The room is full of information and resources.

<description><![CDATA[Mayor Marty Small Sr. joined The Weather Channel to discuss Atlantic City’s storm preparation, highlighting flood-prone areas, beach erosion concerns, and safety measures for residents and tourists.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">As storm conditions continue to affect the Jersey Shore, Mayor Marty Small Sr. joined The Weather Channel’s Reynolds Wolfe to discuss Atlantic City’s readiness, the challenges of flooding, and the city’s commitment to keeping residents and visitors safe.</p><h3 id="">A City Prepared for the Storm</h3><p id="">Despite the threat of strong winds, high surf, and coastal flooding, Mayor Small opened the interview with confidence: <em id="">“Despite the storm, it’s a great day here in the City of Atlantic City. My administration is prepared from the beach patrol to emergency management, to police, to fire, to public works. We’ve got a little bit of experience in this.”</em></p><p id="">The Mayor pointed to several flood-prone neighborhoods of particular concern, including Bungalow Park, Venice Park, Chelsea Heights, and Fairmount Avenue, where moderate flooding was expected around 7:42 PM high tide. While the city projected water levels of 7.6 feet—well below the 10.9 feet recorded during Hurricane Sandy—officials emphasized caution.</p><h3 id="">A Call for Safety</h3><p id="">Mayor Small highlighted both residents and tourists in his message: <em id="">“This is an international destination, the great city of Atlantic City. And as mayor, I’m responsible for the health, welfare, and safety of the residents and the tourists. It’s heed to our warnings. It is very dangerous.”</em></p><p id="">With powerful waves attracting onlookers and surfers, city officials urged the public to avoid risky behavior and remain cautious. Sustained winds of <strong id="">45 mph with gusts up to 55 mph</strong> were expected overnight, compounding the risk of coastal flooding and rip currents.</p><h3 id="">Concerns Over Beaches</h3><p id="">One of the Mayor’s biggest concerns was the potential loss of beaches on the north end of Atlantic City, home to major resorts including Hard Rock, Ocean, Resorts, and Showboat. The Army Corps of Engineers had recently completed a replenishment project, but storm erosion threatened to undo much of the progress. <em id="">“We’re just hoping to salvage some of the beach for the last two weekends of the summer,”</em> the Mayor said, noting that further discussions with federal partners may be needed once the storm passes.</p><h3 id="">A Long Season Ahead</h3><p id="">Asked how the city stays prepared during a long Atlantic hurricane season, Mayor Small compared the challenge to football, proudly invoking his hometown team: <em id="">“It’s just like my football team, the world champion Philadelphia Eagles, which is going to win it again. We’re prepared here—be it events like this, blizzards, nor’easters, and more. We’ve got the professional team to execute and weather the storm.”</em></p><h3 id="">Looking Forward</h3><p id="">While conditions were expected to improve with clearer skies over the weekend, rip currents and flooding risks remain top concerns. Mayor Small reassured the public that Atlantic City has the infrastructure, the experience, and the dedication to respond to whatever Mother Nature brings.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City has long been known for its casinos, boardwalk, and bustling entertainment scene—but one small business has been changing that narrative with bold flavors and culinary innovation. This year, Tony Boloney’s Atlantic City and its spinoff, Mad Mutz Laboratory, were awarded the Innovation Award as part of the City of Atlantic City’s <em id="">“Keep It Local”</em> campaign.</p><p id="">The award was presented by the city’s <strong id="">Economic Development Division</strong> under the Department of Planning &amp; Development, highlighting the critical role that small businesses play in shaping Atlantic City’s identity and strengthening its local economy.</p><h3 id="">From a Convenience Store to a Culinary Institution</h3><p id="">When founder Mike Hauke opened Tony Boloney’s in 2009, the business began as a modest convenience store. But it wasn’t long before Hauke shifted gears, transforming the space into a restaurant that pushed boundaries with imaginative pizzas, sandwiches, and mozzarella creations.</p><p id="">Known for its playful, over-the-top menu, Tony Boloney’s quickly became a destination for food lovers. One of its biggest hits—the flavored mozzarella sticks—was not only a fan favorite but also the spark that inspired Hauke to launch Mad Mutz Laboratory, a dedicated brand built around producing these mozzarella sticks on a larger scale.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1678px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1678px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a8b272ea2daec5515eaf1b_Screenshot%202025-08-23%20015250.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Mad Mutz Laboratory: From Atlantic City to Global Stage</h3><p id="">With the creation of Mad Mutz Laboratory, Hauke and his business partner Michael Burns took a local favorite and elevated it into a product with national and international appeal. Their inventive mozzarella sticks even landed them on ABC’s <em id="">Shark Tank</em>, a milestone that further propelled the brand’s recognition and reach.</p><p id="">What began as a neighborhood eatery has now grown into a globally recognized food brand, demonstrating how a mix of creativity, risk-taking, and dedication can fuel long-term growth and success.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1829px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1829px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a8b282f8f259b3aa01bf1d_Screenshot%202025-08-23%20015303.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Recognized for Innovation</h3><p id="">At the award ceremony, Mayor Marty Small Sr. personally honored Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory, issuing a proclamation that praised the businesses as role models for future entrepreneurs.</p><p id="">“Therefore, I, Mayor Marty Small Sr., Mayor of the great city of Atlantic City, hereby recognize Mad Mutz’s Mozzarella Laboratory for being a role model for future entrepreneurs in the great city of Atlantic City and wish this business continued success both locally and now globally.”</p><p id="">For Hauke, the recognition was deeply meaningful. He described it as “a welcoming surprise” to be honored by the city and proud to see both his and Michael Burns’ work celebrated with the Innovation Award.</p><h3 id="">A Community Built on Creativity</h3><p id="">The story of Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory reflects more than just the rise of a successful business. It highlights the power of innovation in Atlantic City’s small business community and how creative entrepreneurs can help redefine the city’s culture and reputation.</p><p id="">The “Keep It Local” campaign is designed to showcase businesses like Hauke’s that bring something fresh and unexpected to the community, proving that Atlantic City is about more than its casinos—it’s also about flavor, passion, and originality.</p><h3 id="">Looking Ahead</h3><p id="">With a strong foundation built on innovation, national recognition, and global reach, Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory continue to set the bar for what’s possible when big ideas meet local pride. For Hauke and his team, the journey from a convenience store in 2009 to winning an <strong id="">Innovation Award in 2025</strong> is proof that Atlantic City’s entrepreneurial spirit is alive and thriving.</p><p id="">‍</p><h4 id=""><strong id="">#InvestinAC #LiveInAC #WorkInAC</strong></h4>

<p id="">Atlantic City once again witnessed the power of tradition and community last Friday as thousands gathered for the annual Wedding of the Sea Festival, a celebration that honors the city’s long-standing bond with the ocean.</p><p id="">The day began with a special Mass held at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City, drawing residents, visitors, and community leaders together in prayer and reflection. The solemn ceremony set the tone for an event that blended faith, culture, and community spirit.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a49f883f471206826b06d7_534406097_1083581080623027_4609892924536810982_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Following the Mass, Bishop Williams and Mayor Marty Small Sr. led the symbolic tossing of a wreath into the Atlantic Ocean, a gesture that has defined the festival for generations.

Mayor Marty Small Sr.’s Op-Ed in NY Daily News Puts Atlantic City’s Lessons on the National Stage

<description><![CDATA[In the New York Daily News op-ed, Mayor Marty Small Sr. draws on more than four decades of Atlantic City’s experience with gaming to send New York a clear message: if casinos are coming, they must be built to serve the people who live there, not just the developers. Reflecting on both the promises and pitfalls of Atlantic City’s own history, Mayor Small urges New York to pair gaming with long-term investments in housing, infrastructure, small businesses, and community programs — the kind of strategies that have fueled Atlantic City’s recent resurgence.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. is taking the city’s story, and its hard-earned lessons, straight to one of the nation’s largest media markets.</p><p id="">In an opinion piece in the <em id="">New York Daily News</em> published on the August 15th, Mayor Small weighed in on New York’s high-stakes push to license three new downstate casinos. Drawing from more than four decades of lived experience in America’s original East Coast casino town, he issued a clear challenge: if New York is going to build casinos, they must serve the people who live in those neighborhoodsnot just the developers who profit from them.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1080px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1080px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a32a5e995b3a0c7c6dc0cf_GDAC%20Social%20Media%20Post.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">‍</p><h2 id=""><em id="">“Casinos alone don’t build cities. People do,” Mayor Small wrote.</em></h2><p id="">‍</p><p id="">The Mayor’s piece pulls no punches in recalling Atlantic City’s own history. While gaming brought thousands of middle-class jobs and kept city services running, it also displaced families, erased neighborhoods, and failed to deliver the full promise of reinvestment. The lesson, he says, is that casinos must be part of a broader, long-term plan that includes housing, small business support, infrastructure upgrades, and economic diversification.</p><p id="">Mayor Small contrasted New York’s current licensing process, with Coney Island, the Bronx, and Queens among the proposed sites against Atlantic City’s own efforts to strengthen its economy beyond gaming. In recent years, the city has cut property taxes for six straight years, reopened the Atlantic City Aquarium, restored the historic Pop Lloyd Stadium, and secured $50 million to rebuild the Boardwalk and repair streets.</p><p id="">Initiatives like <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com"><strong id=""><em id="">GreatDayAtlanticCity.com</em></strong></a>, launched to give youth and seniors a platform to tell the city’s story, are part of a wider push to ensure growth reaches every neighborhood. Partnerships with Visit Atlantic City, the Greater Atlantic City Chamber, and local development corporations are drawing new private investment — from Stockton University’s expanding campus to the redevelopment of Bader Field.</p><p id="">‍</p><h2 id=""><em id="">“These are the kinds of projects and partnerships that show casinos can be powerful anchors — but only when they’re part of something bigger,” Mayor Small wrote.</em></h2><p id="">‍</p><p id="">The publication in the <em id="">New York Daily News</em> marks a major moment for Atlantic City’s voice in the national conversation. It’s not just about defending the city’s gaming industry, which generates nearly $900 million annually in taxes and fees and supports more than 23,000 jobs. It’s about ensuring that any city, whether Atlantic City or New York, puts its people at the center of its growth strategy.</p><p id="">Mayor Small closed his op-ed with a reminder that resonates far beyond the Boardwalk: “Once the ribbon is cut and the headlines fade, the real work begins — and it will fall on the communities that live with these casinos long after the grand opening.”</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Read the article on the New York Daily News on this link or below:</strong></h2><p id=""><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/15/nyc-casino-lessons-from-atlantic-city/" id="">https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/15/nyc-casino-lessons-from-atlantic-city/</a></p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2000px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2000px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a33b5cf025883388254bee_NewNewspaper%20Clip.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small's Op-Ed in the New York Daily News (August 15, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p id="">‍</p><p id="">‍</p>

<description><![CDATA[Funded by federal, state, and city dollars, the two-year project will transform the roadway from Tennessee to Albany Avenues with safety, traffic, and streetscape upgrades.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">For years, the plan to rebuild Atlantic Avenue, one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares — was stalled by lawsuits, federal grant reviews, and shifting political priorities in Washington. On Thursday, city leaders said those roadblocks have finally been cleared.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small Sr., joined by Representative Jeff Van Drew and other city officials, announced that the reconstruction of Atlantic Avenue from Tennessee to Albany Avenues will go out for bid on Aug. 19, with work expected to begin in October.</p><p id="">The $17.6 million project, part of a $24.8 million, multi-phase overhaul of Atlantic Avenue, is funded by a $10.3 million Federal Highway Administration grant, along with New Jersey Department of Transportation grants and city funds. The federal grant was first approved in November 2021, but the release of funds was delayed for more than two years, most recently until this spring, when Mr. Van Drew pressed for action in Trenton and Washington.</p><p id="">“This is about more than just fresh pavement, it’s an investment in safety and quality of life for our residents,” Mr. Small said. “In government, sometimes things get in the way beyond our control. But this administration kept fighting the good fight for the taxpayers of Atlantic City.”</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1024px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1024px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/689e218a351f4657bf6e551c_Atlantic.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">‍</p><h3 id="">A Test of Persistence and Partnership</h3><p id="">Both men described the process as a test of patience and political will, involving regular phone calls, coordination across agencies, and an unusual degree of bipartisan cooperation in a polarized era.</p><p id="">“This project has been a bumpy ride and a rough road, but it’s finally going to get done,” said Mr. Van Drew, a Republican whose district includes Atlantic City. “Infrastructure shouldn’t be political. It’s about doing the right thing, getting it done, and working together for future generations.”</p><p id="">Mayor Small, a Democrat, underscored that point with a line from the late Atlantic City political figure Ernest Coursey: <em id="">“Every Democrat ain’t my friend, and every Republican is not my enemy.”</em></p><p id="">‍</p><h3 id="">A Corridor Rebuilt</h3><p id="">The funding will pay for resurfacing the roadway, upgrading traffic signals, adding ADA-compliant ramps, installing more than 200 decorative pedestrian lights, and improving signage. The upgrades aim to improve traffic flow, pedestrian safety, and accessibility, while also beautifying the corridor to support local businesses and encourage redevelopment.</p><p id="">The work is expected to take up to 24 months, with a pause during the winter. A previous phase, completed in fall 2023, repaved and restriped Atlantic Avenue from Maine to Tennessee Avenues, replaced lighting, and installed fiber-optic conduit from Tennessee to Albany.</p><h3 id="">More Than Asphalt</h3><p id="">City officials said the Atlantic Avenue improvements are part of a broader strategy to use infrastructure upgrades as a foundation for new development. Jim Rutala, the city’s planning consultant, noted that synchronized traffic signals, a long-sought goal on both Atlantic and Pacific Avenues, will make the corridor more appealing to investors.</p><p id="">“Once the development community knows the infrastructure is in place, other things start to happen,” Mr. Rutala said, pointing to planned projects including a full-service supermarket at Renaissance Plaza, the conversion of a former office building into housing, and the redevelopment of the city’s historic Armory into apartments and a public market.</p><p id="">‍</p><h3 id="">Other Projects on Deck</h3><p id="">The announcement also served as an update on several other infrastructure projects:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Pacific Avenue Signal Optimization Project</strong>: Starting next week, the city will upgrade 35 intersections with new hardware, vehicle detection systems, and seven miles of fiber-optic cable. Road resurfacing will follow conduit and junction box installation.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Baltic Avenue</strong>: Milling and paving from Maine to Missouri Avenues will begin Aug. 21, along with new curbs and sidewalks.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard</strong>: Full reconstruction from Mediterranean Avenue to Route 30 is scheduled to begin this fall.</li></ul><p id="">‍</p><p id="">For Mr. Small, each project reflects a commitment to steady, visible improvements. “This is another box checked under the Small administration,” he said. “We are bullish on infrastructure and will continue to make it a great day in the City of Atlantic City.”</p><p id="">‍</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City High School community celebrated a proud moment as recent graduate Lexi Gormley powered her way to a silver medal at the World U-19 Championships in Trakai, Lithuania, on Sunday, August 10, 2025. Representing the United States as a member of the Junior National Team, Gormley showcased both skill and determination against some of the best young rowers in the world.</p><p id="">The race began with Team USA holding steady in the middle of the pack, but in a stunning late surge, they climbed from sixth place to finish second. Great Britain claimed gold with a time of 6:47.87, followed closely by the United States at 6:49.50, and Romania earning bronze with 6:51.05.</p><p id="">“It was pretty impressive,” said Atlantic City Public Schools Athletic Director Chris Ford. “To see one of our former athletes compete on that level was great. I would not be shocked if she competed in the 2028 Summer Olympics.”</p><p id="">Superintendent of Schools Dr. La’Quetta S. Small praised Gormley’s achievement, calling it a testament to her hard work, discipline, and dedication. “She is an outstanding example for our students, showing them that with perseverance and passion, they can compete – and succeed – on the world stage. We are incredibly proud of her and look forward to seeing all she will accomplish in the future,” Dr. Small said.</p><p id="">For Ford, Gormley’s achievement brought back memories of her relentless training on the school’s rowing equipment. “I wonder if she knows how many miles she’s done on that Erg machine. It feels like a million,” he added with a smile.</p><p id="">This silver medal was not Gormley’s first taste of international success. Just last year, she brought home a bronze medal at the World U-19 Championships in St. Catharines, Canada, also as part of Team USA.</p><p id="">Her story has quickly become a source of inspiration for students across Atlantic City, proving that with commitment, talent, and community support, young athletes can achieve greatness on the global stage.</p><p id="">Gormley’s journey reflects the spirit of Atlantic City — a place where ambition is encouraged, opportunities are created, and determination is rewarded. Her success not only adds to the city’s athletic legacy but also reminds residents why Atlantic City is a community where people can live, work, and grow.</p><p id="">As the oars settled in Lithuania’s waters, the pride rippled back home, reminding everyone that the path from the shores of Atlantic City to the world stage is within reach for those who dare to dream big.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit:<strong id=""> Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In Atlantic City, summer is more than just sunshine and sea breezes — it’s a season of growth, connection, and opportunity. The Atlantic City Rowing Program has become a summer tradition, inspiring young athletes to challenge themselves, discover their strengths, and build lasting friendships both on and off the water.</p><p id="">From the first stroke of the season to the final race, the program blends discipline with joy. Early mornings on the bay become moments of focus and determination, while afternoons are filled with camaraderie and encouragement. Coaches and volunteers guide participants through a mix of technical skill-building, teamwork exercises, and personal goal-setting — lessons that carry far beyond the sport itself.</p><h6 id=""><strong id="">A City That Invests in Its Youth</strong>Atlantic City’s Rowing Program is more than a recreational activity. It’s a community effort to nurture resilience, perseverance, and leadership in the city’s next generation. By engaging youth in meaningful physical activity and providing them with positive role models, the program strengthens the fabric of the community.</h6><p id="">Parents, supporters, and local leaders see the value in these moments — the discipline that comes from training, the sportsmanship learned through competition, and the confidence built from mastering new skills. These qualities prepare young people not just for rowing, but for life.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Real Skills. Real Impact.</strong><br>While the program builds strong rowers, its real success lies in shaping well-rounded individuals. Participants learn the importance of commitment, how to push through challenges, and the reward of achieving shared goals. Friendships formed on the water become bonds that last well beyond the summer season.</p><p id="">The annual banquet, a highlight of the program, celebrates more than just trophies. It’s a gathering where families, coaches, and teammates reflect on the journey, share stories, and acknowledge the dedication shown throughout the season. It’s proof that in Atlantic City, success is measured not only by wins, but by growth.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Why Live, Work, and Grow in Atlantic City</strong><br>Programs like the Atlantic City Rowing Program show why this is a community where people can build a life. It’s a place that invests in its young people, offers unique opportunities to explore passions, and fosters a culture of encouragement and belonging.</p><p id="">Whether you’re raising a family, building a career, or simply seeking a strong sense of community, Atlantic City offers a quality of life where opportunity meets inspiration — on the water and beyond.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Atlantic City Recreation</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[Atlantic City’s first responders, alongside neighboring agencies, successfully contained a massive three-alarm fire at the unoccupied New Jersey Avenue School. No injuries were reported, and the fire was brought under control after hours of dedicated effort.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The City of Atlantic City reported that a massive three-alarm fire erupted at the New Jersey Avenue School late in the evening, prompting an immediate and coordinated response from multiple agencies. The Atlantic City Fire Department, joined by the Atlantic City Police Department, EMS, and several neighboring agencies, worked together to battle the flames well into the night. Their swift arrival at the scene and expert handling of the situation prevented the blaze from spreading to nearby buildings, safeguarding the surrounding community.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f497a1c557edf402b0a9_531118717_1075913544723114_603322577280384747_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The building, which had been unoccupied at the time of the incident, was slated for demolition, meaning there were no students, faculty, or staff inside. While the absence of occupants was a relief, the scale and intensity of the fire posed a significant challenge to the crews on site. Firefighters employed strategic measures to contain the flames, using both ground and aerial operations to bring the situation under control.</p><p id="">As the hours passed, the tireless efforts of the first responders paid off. By the early morning, the fire was declared under control, and officials confirmed that there were no injuries to either civilians or emergency personnel. This outcome was a testament to the training, dedication, and resilience of the men and women on the front lines.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f4a8dd796cf433ddbee2_529937513_1075913741389761_5537573666956042330_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The operation underscored the importance of inter-agency collaboration during emergencies. Neighboring fire departments and emergency units provided critical reinforcement, offering additional manpower, equipment, and logistical assistance that allowed the Atlantic City teams to sustain their efforts throughout the night. Every individual involved played a vital role in the successful containment of the fire, from those directing traffic to the firefighters battling flames in hazardous conditions.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f4b6224b680adc165e53_529816090_1075913761389759_2580476976676799632_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">City officials extended heartfelt gratitude to all <strong id="">brave men and women</strong> who risked their safety to protect lives and property. Their courage, skill, and commitment to service stood as a reminder of the extraordinary work done by first responders every day, often without recognition. The incident at the New Jersey Avenue School demonstrated not only the dangers they face but also the unwavering determination they bring to every call.</p><p id="">In the aftermath, authorities began their investigation into the cause of the blaze, while crews remained on-site to monitor for potential flare-ups. The community, though shaken by the dramatic event, expressed overwhelming appreciation for the coordinated and professional response that prevented what could have been a far greater tragedy.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">City of Atlantic City</strong></p>

<p id="">In Atlantic City, community isn’t just a concept — it’s something you can see, feel, and even taste.

<p id="">In Atlantic City, summer is more than sunshine and ocean breezes, it’s also a time when the city moves forward. This year, the City of Atlantic City demonstrated its ongoing commitment to residents by adding brand-new vehicles to the Department of Public Works fleet, ensuring services remain efficient, reliable, and ready to meet community needs year-round.</p><p id="">With these new additions, the city has strengthened its ability to deliver essential public services. Whether it’s keeping streets clean, maintaining infrastructure, or responding quickly to seasonal demands, the expanded fleet helps ensure that Atlantic City runs smoothly for everyone who calls it home.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/689609c54c22c96c78d1ab56_529375203_1074411898206612_361101157321984353_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Building the Tools for Better Service</strong><br>Among the upgrades is a high-reach bucket truck for electrical work, enabling crews to handle repairs and maintenance more quickly and safely. The city also added large and small rear-load garbage trucks, boosting sanitation efforts and supporting cleaner neighborhoods from the Boardwalk to the backstreets.</p><p id="">To keep the city prepared for storm season, stormwater vactor trucks now help maintain catch basins and prevent flooding. And with a universal hook-lift truck equipped for multiple tasks — from snow plowing in winter to leaf collection in autumn — Atlantic City is better equipped for every season.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Year-Round Commitment to Quality of Life</strong><br>Each vehicle serves a specific purpose, but together they represent a bigger vision: a city that invests in the tools needed to care for its people and places. It’s about more than machinery — it’s about keeping Atlantic City a cleaner, safer, and more welcoming place for residents, businesses, and visitors.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/689609d23850ae33030716e7_528290469_1074412028206599_1901651306518018189_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Why Atlantic City Is a Great Place to Live and Work</strong><br>Investments like this reflect the spirit of Atlantic City — a community that takes pride in maintaining its neighborhoods, supporting its workforce, and creating an environment where opportunity thrives.
