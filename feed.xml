<description><![CDATA[November was a month of revitalization, celebration, and community pride in Atlantic City. From major infrastructure upgrades to cultural recognition and heartfelt local events, the Great Day Gazette captured how the city continued to grow stronger together.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AtlanticCityGov" id=""><strong id="">City of Atlantic City</strong></a> continued its revitalization efforts this November, focusing on infrastructure, community connection, and celebration. Major updates, new programs, and heartwarming stories shaped another <strong id="">great month</strong> in the city’s journey toward progress and unity.</p><p id="">The city’s infrastructure saw significant improvements as Pacific Avenue joined the paving program, aligning with the ongoing Atlantic Avenue repaving project. The initiative was strengthened by a total of $5.3 million in NJDOT grant funding, supporting road enhancements and synchronized traffic signal upgrades across key corridors. Additionally, $684,708 was allocated for new pedestrian sidewalks along the Black Horse Pike, improving safety for students and families traveling between Atlantic City High School and Chelsea Heights.</p><p id="">Progress was also visible in other neighborhoods. The Baltic Avenue paving project neared completion, while the MLK Boulevard upgrade moved into the milling and paving phase. Meanwhile, construction reviews were underway for the Atlantic Avenue paving from Tennessee to Albany Avenues—marking another milestone in the city’s ongoing development plan.</p><p id="">Community spaces also came back to life with the long-awaited grand opening of Weekes Memorial Park. After years of careful restoration, this park once again became a welcoming gathering space for residents. The redesign featured landscaping, artistic displays, sustainable features, and accessibility upgrades, symbolizing the city’s commitment to safety, inclusion, and green living.</p><p id="">Listening to resident feedback, the Public Works Department installed additional stop signs at Winchester and Dover Avenues to ensure improved pedestrian and traffic safety—another example of how the city acted on community input to enhance neighborhood well-being.</p><p id="">The city celebrated the season with family-friendly festivities. Harvest Town filled Gardner’s Basin with music, games, costumes, and community resource tables, bringing together families for an afternoon of fun and connection. Likewise, Senior Services hosted a pumpkin decorating event, adding creativity and color to the fall spirit.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1080px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1080px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/690cd2e961cd3b661040eab9_Screenshot%202025-11-07%20004526-Picsart-AiImageEnhancer.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">Fall evenings came alive at Bader Field during the Drive-In Movie &amp; S’mores Night, where families gathered under the crisp night sky to enjoy a family film, fires, and free refreshments. The event also provided free winter hats and gloves, ensuring everyone stayed warm while celebrating together. Meanwhile, Atlantic City Recreation wrapped up another successful T-ball season, helping young athletes learn teamwork and skill in a positive environment.</p><p id="">Acts of heroism and recognition took center stage this month as well. The Atlantic City Police Foundation Hero Luncheon honored Sgt. Jonathan Walsh for saving a swimmer from drowning and Treasurer James Kutch for his years of dedicated service. During the same period, Officer Matt Schmidt received national attention for rescuing an injured canine from the icy October bay waters, showcasing the bravery and compassion of the city’s first responders.</p><p id="">Atlantic City also paid tribute to Rita and Anthony Mack, longtime business owners and community leaders, by dedicating a section of Arctic Avenue in their honor. For nearly four decades, the Macks provided employment, mentorship, and opportunities to countless residents through their McDonald’s franchises, making a lasting impact on the community they loved.</p><p id="">The city’s diversity and unity were celebrated as Mayor Marty Small Sr. and the Office of Multicultural Services received the Diaspora Excellence Award from Rediscover Africa 2025 and the Ghanaian Associations of South Jersey and Atlantic City. The recognition reflected the city’s ongoing commitment to cultural inclusion and the success of historic events like the Ghana Flag Raising Ceremony—the first of its kind in New Jersey.</p><p id="">November also emphasized health and wellness through the Pink Walk for a Purpose, a citywide event for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, where employees joined together to walk in support of survivors and ongoing fighters. Meanwhile, the Re-Entry Services Division held a family reunification event at the All Wars Memorial Building, providing food, fun, and creative activities that brought families closer together.</p><p id="">Finally, Atlantic City Youth Services launched an empowering martial arts program, teaching children the 3 S’s—Self-confidence, Self-reliance, and Self-defense—as part of a series of exciting fall programs designed to engage the city’s youth in positive growth and discipline.</p><p id="">From infrastructure renewal and community celebrations to acts of heroism and cultural recognition, November 2025 stood as another milestone month for Atlantic City—reminding everyone that every day truly is a Great Day in Atlantic City.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City community has been lovin’ longtime Atlantic City McDonald’s owners Rita and Anthony Mack for the last four decades, and they’ve been lovin’ the community right back. And now, the City of Atlantic City has honored these two community icons with a street dedication recognizing their nearly 40 years of business excellence, community impact, and entrepreneurial leadership in the city.</p><p id="">Arctic Avenue between Michigan and Arkansas Avenues has been named <em id="">Rita and Anthony Mack Avenue</em>, paying tribute to the couple who owned and operated multiple McDonald’s franchises in Atlantic City, with their first one purchased in June 1986 and final one sold in May 2024 as they embarked on a much-deserved retirement.</p><p id="">The Macks are the definition of successful entrepreneurship in Atlantic City. Long before casinos dominated the city’s economy, there was a generation of African American business leaders who built strong, community-based enterprises that anchored neighborhoods and provided opportunity. Today, as Atlantic City’s Economic Development division under the Department of Planning and Development works to revitalize that same spirit of local ownership and empowerment, the Macks stand as living proof that businesses –especially minority-owned ones - can not only survive but thrive in Atlantic City. Rita and Anthony Mack have been the blueprint for success, showing what’s possible through hard work, generosity, and a deep commitment to community.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68fa511a331427c439d9baf0_Mack%E2%80%99s%20Street%20%20_85.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small presents the Macks with a version of their street sign to take home (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">“We really appreciate your many years of service, your selfless service, and your dedication to the Great City of Atlantic City community," Mayor Small told the Macks during the Street Dedication Ceremony in their honor. It was during this ceremony that the couple also received a custom street sign to take home, symbolizing the enduring legacy they have built.</p><p id="">Rita and Anthony Mack expressed deep gratitude for the recognition and for the community that supported them from the beginning.</p><p id="">“We are incredibly honored and humbled to receive this awesome recognition,” said Rita Mack. “The renaming of this city block to <em id="">Rita and Anthony Mack Avenue</em> is an undeniable dream for us. It’s the very block where we began our business journey in 1986, and we are thrilled beyond belief.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:4305px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="4305px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68fa5195b15ae74d2e622535_Mack%E2%80%99s%20Street%20%20_73.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Rita Mack speaking during the Street Dedication Ceremony in her and huer husband's honor (Credit: Edward Lea / city of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">Reflecting on their journey, Rita added:</p><p id="">“They say the most critical factors in choosing a franchise are location, location, location. I must say, we struck gold when we purchased our Arkansas Avenue site. But we were also blessed to find ourselves in a supportive and caring community. From the very beginning, this community has embraced and supported us in so many ways.”</p><p id="">The Macks hope that others — especially young people and aspiring entrepreneurs — will be inspired each time they pass <em id="">Rita and Anthony Mack Avenue</em>, a lasting reminder that dreams can be built right here in Atlantic City. </p><p id="">Their name now rightfully takes its place in the heart of Atlantic City in recognition of their extraordinary contributions. </p><p id="">‍</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Get ready to taste something new in Atlantic City! Starting November 1, 2025, the city will officially launch its food truck operations at two popular public destinations—Gardner’s Basin and O’Donnell Memorial Park—bringing more dining variety, energy, and opportunity to the community.</p><p id="">Approved unanimously by City Council earlier this year, this initiative reflects Atlantic City’s growing commitment to supporting small businesses and enhancing its outdoor spaces. The Office of Economic Development and Department of Planning &amp; Development have been working closely with Public Works and Licensing &amp; Inspection to prepare each site with new signage, designated vendor spaces, and clear operating guidelines to ensure a smooth launch.</p><p id="">At O’Donnell Memorial Park, food trucks will be positioned along Captain John O’Donnell Parkway, offering easy access for residents and visitors exploring the area. Meanwhile, at Gardner’s Basin, trucks will operate along the roadway between the Seawall parking lot and the Atlantic City Aquarium, providing guests with convenient and delicious options by the water.</p><p id="">Each location will accommodate up to eight registered and approved food trucks, operating daily from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Interested vendors can now apply through the City of Atlantic City website at <a target="_new" href="http://www.acnj.gov" id="">www.acnj.gov</a>. Applications open on October 6, 2025, under the Licensing &amp; Inspection section—simply select <em id="">Food Truck</em> under <em id="">Business Licenses/Mercantile</em>.</p><p id="">“This is another exciting step in showing that Atlantic City is open for business,” said Mayor Marty Small, Sr. “We’re creating opportunities for small businesses, generating tax revenue, and giving residents and visitors more affordable food options in two of our most visited public areas.”</p><p id="">Bruce Weekes, Assistant Director of Economic Development, added, “Residents have asked for this for years—and we listened. Our goal is for this program to serve as a stepping stone for food operators to establish themselves right here in Atlantic City, grow their brands, and eventually open permanent storefronts.”</p><p id="">All participating food trucks will be inspected and approved by the City of Atlantic City Health Department and the Atlantic City Fire Department before operation. Vendors will be responsible for maintaining cleanliness and following all city regulations. Please note that the sale of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis is strictly prohibited.</p><p id="">With this new initiative, Atlantic City continues to prove that it’s not just a destination—it’s a community of opportunity, where entrepreneurs can thrive and residents can enjoy diverse, local experiences every day.</p>

Building a walkway to link the Atlantic City High School to the city is an important safety improvement.”</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68ef9eb2d711fcf45314888a_561360750_1132001425780992_646044056608143276_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">Infrastructure Projects Transforming the City</strong></h3><p id="">Across Atlantic City, infrastructure upgrades are reshaping the city’s streets, corridors, and connections between neighborhoods.

What began as an internal newsletter has grown into a dynamic publication that celebrates everything that makes Atlantic City an extraordinary place to live, work, and thrive.</p><p id="">The rebrand comes at an exciting time, aligning with the launch of the Great Day Atlantic City app—a digital platform designed to shine a light on the people, progress, and positive news happening across the city. Together, the Gazette and the app form a powerful communication hub, keeping residents, employees, and visitors informed about all the great things taking place within Atlantic City.</p><p id="">In his opening message, Mayor Marty Small Sr. expressed enthusiasm for the Gazette’s evolution and the city’s renewed focus on positivity and transparency. “There are way too many negative voices out there when it comes to the Great City of Atlantic City,” the Mayor said. “The Great Day platform gives all the positives, which far outweigh the negatives—the spotlight they deserve.”</p><p id="">This month’s issue of the Great Day Gazette is packed with inspiring stories, community highlights, and exciting updates. Readers can look back on the success of <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com/news/positive-culture-shift-for-atlantic-city-employees-continues-with-mayor-smalls-great-day-event" id=""><strong id="">Great Day 2025</strong></a>, a day of motivation and team building for city employees dedicated to the memory of Chief of Staff Ernest Coursey. The event featured keynote speaker Nehemiah Davis, who encouraged city staff to focus on growth, resilience, and becoming the best versions of themselves.</p><p id="">The Gazette also covers the city’s presence at the first Atlantic City Strategic Communications Summit, hosted by Stockton University and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA). There, the city’s Marketing Team—including Public Information Officer Andrew Kramer, Assistant PIO Adele Polk, Shennita Williams, and Ziggy Chau of Lucky PR—presented Great Day Atlantic City as a leading example of civic storytelling and community engagement. The summit emphasized collaboration and shared messaging across local institutions to build a stronger, unified voice for Atlantic City.</p><p id="">Readers will also find updates on major development and infrastructure projects. Mayor Small joined community leaders for the grand opening of The Seahaus Hotel and Cucina Del Mar, celebrating the continued growth of Atlantic City’s hospitality sector. Meanwhile, the city began the long-anticipated revitalization of Atlantic Avenue—a transformative project that includes new paving, traffic signal upgrades, ADA-compliant ramps, enhanced lighting, and beautification improvements designed to make the corridor safer and more welcoming for all.</p><p id="">Economic opportunity and small business growth are also front and center. The Gazette highlights the Small Business Micro Grant Program, providing reimbursement support for local businesses through federal ARPA funding, and the new food truck program opening two prime locations—Gardner’s Basin and O’Donnell Memorial Park—to bring affordable dining options and entrepreneurial opportunities to the community.</p><p id="">In Public Safety News, the friendly rivalry between the Atlantic City Fire Department and Police Department took center stage during the first-ever Mayor’s Cup Softball Game. The community gathered at Pop Lloyd Stadium to cheer on both teams, celebrating camaraderie and civic pride. The issue also recognized newly promoted fire officers and honored the city’s first responders during the Atlantic City 9/11 Memorial Ceremony.</p><p id="">The Gazette continued its tradition of celebrating people and programs that make Atlantic City vibrant—from Senior Appreciation Day and Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations at City Hall, to new youth initiatives including the Youth Theater Program, Girl Scouts sessions, and Little Leapers gymnastics.

Positive Culture Shift for Atlantic City Employees Continues with Mayor Small’s ‘Great Day’ Event

<description><![CDATA[The annual 'Great Day' event is Mayor Small's signature initiative to strengthen workforce climate and culture, boost morale, and unite City of Atlantic City employees as one team.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small, Sr. has long said that to truly build Atlantic City, the transformation must begin from the inside out. Since becoming mayor in October 2019, he’s turned that vision into action, reshaping the culture of City Hall and setting a new standard for local government. From his first days in office, Mayor Small raised expectations for every department and made accountability a cornerstone of his administration. He’s expanded opportunities for advancement through internal mobility, promotions, and well-earned raises, ensuring that dedicated employees see a future in public service. Just as importantly, he has invested heavily in training programs that give staff unprecedented professional development and the skills needed to better serve Atlantic City taxpayers.</p><p id="">That commitment came into full focus at this year’s <strong id="">Great Day 2025</strong> event held at the Showboat Resort for a third straight year. This is the mayor’s signature initiative to strengthen workforce climate and culture, boost morale, and unite City of Atlantic City employees as one team. It’s the only time each year every city worker gathers under one roof outside city buildings to receive key organizational updates directly from the mayor and gain fresh perspective from nationally recognized outside sources.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab55fbfa7c8670733811c_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_160.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small and guest speaker Nehemiah Davis during Great Day 2025 at Showboat Resort (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">This year’s motivational speaker was philanthropist Nehemiah Davis, who shared his inspiring journey from humble beginnings in Philadelphia—where he frequently found himself getting into trouble—to becoming a prominent figure dedicated to helping others transform their lives. Addressing City of Atlantic City employees, Davis encouraged them to write down the affirmation: “I’m committed and focused on making this the best year ever.” He emphasized how mindset shifts can lead to real change and challenged staff to stop saying, “I have to go to work,” and instead embrace the privilege of being able to say, “I get to go to work”— especially in a place like Atlantic City.</p><p id="">Great Day 2025 carried added significance this year, as it was held in memory of the late Chief of Staff Ernest Coursey. Known for his unwavering dedication as a public servant and his deep care for city employees, Coursey left a lasting legacy. In his honor, all staff wore commemorative shirts, and the city announced the upcoming launch of the Coursey Cares Health&amp; Wellness Challenge, an initiative aimed at promoting small, sustainable lifestyle changes that employees can carry with them for life.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:4817px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="4817px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab5d59d961afd2648ce17_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_15.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">The City of Atlantic City Health &amp; Human Serivces Department, CDBG Office and Public Information Office share details of the Coursey Cares Challenge during Great Day 2025 (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">Following the professional development portion of the day, employees get to relax and connect at Showboat’s Island Waterpark, and this year was no exception. With more than 700 employees spread across City Hall, the Public Safety Building, the Public Works Yard, and other locations, some staff members rarely cross paths, if ever. But on this one day a year, in the open, informal setting of the waterpark, colleagues can interact, bond, and build stronger relationships. Team building is a cornerstone of the Small Administration. It’s why each department is tasked with organizing its own annual retreat outside the Great Day event, and why Mayor Small personally leads a retreat for his directors. </p><p id="">A recent article from <em id="">The Press of Atlantic City</em> covering Great Day 2025 failed to spotlight the most critical component of the event, which is Mayor Small’s mission to raise expectations, invest in employee development, and celebrate the city's workforce. Mayor Small is demonstrating that a city government can evolve from within—and Great Day 2025 is a shining example of that transformation. His message is clear: when the workforce is motivated, well-trained, and connected, the entire Atlantic City community reaps the rewards.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab6a89f3e7cc7d1e0d652_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_96.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">City staff getting to unwind at Island Waterpark at the conclusion of Great Day 2025 (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In <strong id="">Atlantic City</strong>, progress is not just measured in buildings or investments — it is reflected in the success of the small businesses that form the city’s backbone. Through its Keep It Local campaign, led by the Economic Development division under the Planning &amp; Development Department, the City of Atlantic City recognized the vital role that local entrepreneurs play in shaping the community’s future.</p><p id="">One highlight of this effort was the presentation of the Economic Growth &amp; Development Award to Kelsey’s Atlantic City, a local restaurant that has become a cultural landmark. For years, owners Kelsey and Kimberly Jackson worked tirelessly to serve not only food, but also hospitality that felt like home.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1790px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1790px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da883d99c301bd857fd2cb_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20212304.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">From its very beginning,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/kelseysatlanticcity" id=""> <strong id="">Kelsey’s</strong></a> was more than a place to eat. It was a gathering space where neighbors could share southern comfort meals, enjoy live music, and feel connected. It showed how a business could grow into a community institution, weaving itself into the everyday life of Atlantic City.</p><p id="">With three locations across the city, Kelsey’s also became a driver of local economic activity. By welcoming both residents and visitors, it drew people into neighborhoods, fueled local spending, and created job opportunities. In doing so, it embodied the spirit of growth and resilience that defines Atlantic City.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1350px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1350px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da86d77a2c0bf32080aaa1_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20211530.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The recognition of Kelsey’s demonstrated how local businesses reflect the larger momentum happening in the city. As Atlantic City invested in its neighborhoods, public spaces, and small enterprises, the success stories of people like the Jackson family became proof that the city’s vision of renewal was not only possible but already taking shape.</p><p id="">Receiving the award was described by Kelsey Jackson as “an honor and a privilege.” He emphasized that the acknowledgment was a testament to the dedication and effort put into the business over the years. Kimberly Jackson added that Atlantic City itself was “doing better than ever,” reflecting the citywide growth happening all around them.</p><p id="">Stories like Kelsey’s show why Atlantic City is more than a place to visit — it is a city to believe in. It is a place where hard work is recognized, where local culture thrives, and where economic development goes hand in hand with community spirit.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1426px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1426px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da86eff6932921eb1f8a71_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20211508.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">This recognition stood as a reminder that Atlantic City is not only a destination for entertainment but also a community where people can put down roots, build businesses, and create lasting impact. It is a city where individuals can find opportunity, connection, and pride.</p><p id="">Every award, every campaign, and every small business success adds to a bigger story — a story of a city moving forward together. Atlantic City is not just about what it offers to visitors; it is about what it provides to its own residents: a place to live, to work, and to grow.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">When Sophia Mammucari tells young people in Atlantic City, <em id="">“This city doesn’t limit you,”</em> she’s not just offering encouragement—she’s living proof of what’s possible.</p><p id="">Now a sophomore at Harvard University, Mammucari’s journey began in the heart of Atlantic City. Despite moving frequently during her early years, her family ultimately made Atlantic City home. It was there, as a student at Atlantic City High School, that she began to dream big and build the foundation that would carry her all the way to the Ivy League.</p><p id="">“Getting into Harvard was the best day of my life,” she said.</p><p id="">Mammucari is not only thriving academically, but she’s also giving back to the city that raised her. This summer, she returned home to intern with the City of Atlantic City Mayor’s Office and Business Administration Office, where she gained firsthand experience in how municipal government functions.</p><p id="">“I just wanted to learn how government works,” she explained. “I saw the full process, and it was full circle. My journey ended with the City Council meeting, so I saw how ordinances were written, how issues were addressed, all of the meetings that go into it, all the planning, and how there isn’t always a simple answer to everything. The Business Administrator (Anthony Swan) and Mayor (Small) really do work to address all concerns that come to City Hall.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68c826f2c143c131d2eb8f3e_Sophia%20Storm.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">As part of her summer internship with the City of Atlantic City, Sophia Mammucari got to take part in one of Mayor Small's news conferences. </figcaption></figure><p id="">Through programs like CitiStat, which allows residents to report and track issues through data-driven governance, Mammucari got to see how committed the city is to its own revitalization.</p><p id="">“I was impressed by how much work is being done to improve Atlantic City and to create a real renaissance,” she added.</p><p id="">Mammucari’s connection to the Small administration runs deeper than her internship. She is also a previous recipient of the <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com/department-stories/from-dream-to-degree-atlantic-citys-3m-scholarship-fund-is-changing-lives" id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship</a>, three-year, $3 million initiative supporting Atlantic City students in their pursuit of higher education.</p><p id="">“The scholarships helped me with my expenses during college and made it possible to go to Harvard and excel there,” she said.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:3791px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="3791px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68c82812c8908ded144f07dc_96-AC%20Scholarship%202024%20637.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Sophia Mammucari is a former 'Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship' recipient.</figcaption></figure><p id="">While she’s currently making her mark in Boston, Mammucari hasn’t forgotten where she came from. She hopes to one day return to Atlantic City and introduce her organization, <a href="https://www.thehigheredvantage.org/" target="_blank" id=""><strong id=""><em id="">The Higher EDvantage</em></strong></a>, to local students. The nonprofit offers guidance and support for those pursuing college or another form of higher education.</p><p id="">And her ambitions don’t stop there. Could “Mayor Mammucari” be in the city’s future?</p><p id="">“I don’t want to take Mayor Small’s job,” she said with a smile. “But maybe when he retires, I’d love to run for a government position.”</p><p id="">For now, Mammucari remains focused on her education—and on serving as a role model for the next generation of Atlantic City youth.</p><p id="">“I hope I can be someone local students look up to,” she said. “I always encourage kids—especially those from low-income backgrounds or who go to Atlantic City High School—to dream big. You may not think you’re capable, but the answer is always going to be no if you don’t try.”</p><p id="">If anyone ever doubts her hometown or says something negative about it, Mammucari is ready to set the record straight! And she now has the inside experience to back her stance and looks forward to sharing with the world why she is proud to be from Atlantic City and just how much potential this city truly has.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">PHOTOS BY <strong id="">EDWARD LEA / CITY OF ATLANTIC CITY</strong></p>

Through the <strong>“Keep It Local” </strong>campaign, the City of Atlantic City recognized small businesses that played a vital role in shaping the city’s economy and identity.</p><p id="">At the heart of this celebration was the Business Excellence Award, presented to one of the city’s most iconic establishments: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/docksoysterhouseac" id=""><strong id="">Dock’s Oyster House</strong></a>.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Legacy of Excellence</strong><br>Since opening its doors in 1897, Dock’s Oyster House had remained true to its mission — to serve the finest meals in a welcoming atmosphere. Generations of the Dougherty family guided the restaurant through expansion and transformation, while staying rooted in the values that made it a cornerstone of Atlantic City’s dining scene.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Dining Experience That Lasts Generations</strong><br>Guests at Dock’s enjoyed both tradition and innovation. The Pan Sauteed Crab Cakes and Crispy Wasabi Tuna, highlighted by Executive Chef Stephan Johnson, were just two examples of dishes that continued to delight visitors year after year. The restaurant also became known for one of the most popular happy hours in town, drawing both locals and visitors together in celebration of good food and community spirit.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1804px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1804px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68c4302e45f831750f0c8f26_Screenshot%202025-09-12%20223641.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Stephan Johnson-Executive Chef</figcaption></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Hands-On Leadership</strong><br>For more than two decades, Chef Johnson had been a part of Dock’s story. He praised the Dougherty family for their dedication and leadership, noting how their hands-on involvement kept the restaurant not only successful but deeply connected to its community. Their commitment reflected why Dock’s stood as a natural choice for the Business Excellence Award.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Why Atlantic City Believes in Its Businesses</strong><br>Just as the city invests in its youth, neighborhoods, and culture, it also honors the businesses that bring Atlantic City to life. Local restaurants, shops, and services are more than places of commerce — they are spaces where traditions thrive, opportunities grow, and families build memories.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Place to Live and Work</strong><br>The recognition of Dock’s Oyster House illustrated what made Atlantic City such a vibrant place to live and work.
