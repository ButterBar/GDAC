From tasting diverse cuisines to experiencing the sights and sounds of a different urban environment, the trip offered both enjoyment and a chance to connect with one another beyond city borders.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685c07114da75c234b7a0af9_511001917_738182325554483_3547819416052801395_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">“Each of these events served as a reminder of our city's rich diversity and the importance of fostering spaces where everyone feels seen, supported, and celebrated,” said a representative from the department.</p><p id="">The week’s programming underscored the department’s ongoing mission to bridge communities, elevate voices, and promote shared experiences across cultural lines.

<description><![CDATA[The Atlantic City Police Athletic League, Police Department, and community leaders came together to unveil a new wrestling mat and launch the city's first coed youth wrestling team—the Atlantic City Lions—providing local youth with a powerful outlet for discipline, strength, and self-worth.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City took a major step forward in youth development and community engagement with the launch of the Atlantic City Lions, the city's first-ever youth wrestling team. In a joint effort between the Atlantic City Police Athletic League (PAL), the Atlantic City Police Department, and the Atlantic City Police Foundation, the initiative was made official with the donation of a brand-new 40-by-42-foot wrestling mat featuring bold logos for PAL, ACPD, and the newly formed team.</p><p id="">The mat, installed at the PAL building on New York Avenue, symbolized much more than a place to train—it represented opportunity, mentorship, and the beginning of a new athletic chapter for the city’s youth. Coach Marcus Holmes, an Atlantic City firefighter and former wrestler, leads the program with a mission to unite local kids, give them an outlet beyond the streets, and teach them valuable life skills such as resilience, patience, and self-discipline.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1201px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1201px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685ae7c73a33689b8e17c077_Screenshot%202025-06-25%20020022.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The team is coed and expected to draw over 50 youth athletes from across the city. Young wrestlers like Edward Balderas Cruz and Giovanny Jimenez shared how the sport has already impacted them, improving their strength, speed, confidence, and commitment.</p><p id="">For Lt. Will Santiago, PAL’s executive director and Atlantic City native, the project is deeply personal. Recognizing that many local youth gravitate only toward football or basketball, Santiago said introducing wrestling offers an important alternative path that can keep kids engaged, healthy, and off the streets.</p><p id="">Police Chief James Sarkos, who wrestled in high school, was instrumental in making the vision a reality. Citing his own experience with the sport’s positive influence on self-esteem and focus, he emphasized the importance of finding the right coach and the right setting to build long-term enthusiasm. Sarkos also noted the sport’s potential to open doors to college scholarships and future opportunities.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1388px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1388px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685ae8494614e2207bb19d74_Screenshot%202025-06-25%20020205.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz applauded the effort, calling the turnout and investment “tremendous” and highlighting PAL’s ongoing commitment to enriching the lives of young people. The PAL building continues to offer a variety of activities, including track, boxing, flag football, basketball, and a computer room for schoolwork—further proving that this isn’t just about sports, but about building a supportive environment where children can thrive.</p><p id="">With strong community support, a passionate coaching staff, and a clear mission, the Atlantic City Lions have already begun shaping the city’s next generation—on the mat and beyond.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Last month, the City of Atlantic City successfully launched the Keep It Local campaign in celebration of Small Business Month, further cementing its dedication to uplifting and empowering neighborhood entrepreneurs. The campaign served as a city-wide reminder of the importance of choosing to shop, dine, and explore right here in Atlantic City—supporting the very businesses that define the local economy and culture.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68596186eae8019d03a56df2_510291478_1036392375341898_4069952575013346144_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The initiative encouraged residents and visitors alike to recognize the real impact of spending their dollars within the community. From local restaurants to neighborhood shops, each transaction was a vote of confidence in the people who invest daily in Atlantic City’s future. More than just a call to action, the campaign became a celebration of identity and pride.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1262px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1262px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6859613152defbe43f435374_Screenshot%202025-06-23%20221304.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Central to the campaign’s success was the leadership and involvement of <strong id="">City Council President Aaron 'Sporty' Randolph</strong>, <strong id="">Council Vice President Kaleem Shabazz</strong>, and <strong id="">Councilwoman Maria Lacca</strong>.

These signs, now displayed proudly across storefronts, served as powerful visual cues urging consumers to think local first.</p><p id="">Business owners welcomed the movement with enthusiasm, embracing the opportunity to highlight their participation in the campaign. Many not only displayed their signs but also shared the initiative’s message across their platforms, helping it gain traction both in-person and online.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6859619e6421480ee70e5112_510153739_1036392268675242_1090472342544867848_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The timing of the campaign aligned perfectly with Small Business Month, but its impact extended far beyond that.

<description><![CDATA[Mayor Marty Small’s $3 million scholarship initiative is changing lives in Atlantic City. In its third year, the program awarded 113 scholarships, supporting high school grads, college students, trade school enrollees, and advanced degree seekers. It’s a bold investment in local talent and a powerful example of how Atlantic City is building a community where people can live, learn, and thrive.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City isn't just a place to vacation, it's a city where futures are built. Through a bold, three-year, $3 million commitment led by Mayor Marty Small, Sr., the city is changing the trajectory for students and families by making higher education and career training more accessible than ever before.</p><p id="">Now in its third and final year, the Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship Program awarded 113 scholarships of up to $10,000 each to Atlantic City residents in 2025. That’s more than the expected 100 scholarships typically granted per year, thanks to remaining funds. The scholarships are funded through the American Rescue Plan under the Addressing Educational Disparity category.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68531d9da90fa6721b0b43a9_achs3.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68531e6174b37601139ed4ab_achs1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">‍</p><p id="">‍</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">#LiveinAC: A City That Invests in Its Youth</strong></h3><p id="">This initiative sends a powerful message to Atlantic City families: your city sees you, believes in you, and is investing in your success. For residents, especially those balancing financial challenges, this kind of support makes the dream of college or trade school not only imaginable but attainable. It also makes Atlantic City a desirable place to raise a family, where education isn’t just encouraged, it’s funded.</p><p id="">The scholarships are open to all Atlantic City residents, regardless of which high school they currently attend or previously attended. This inclusive approach ensures the program reaches students across the city, from recent high school grads and current college students to those pursuing advanced degrees and trade certifications.</p><h3 id="">#WorkinAC: Building the Talent Pipeline</h3><p id="">This year’s breakdown reflects a broad investment in Atlantic City’s growing talent pool:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">44 scholarships</strong> for high school graduates entering college</li><li id=""><strong id="">52 scholarships</strong> for current college students advancing to sophomore, junior, or senior year</li><li id=""><strong id="">11 scholarships</strong> for graduate students pursuing a Master’s or Doctorate</li><li id=""><strong id="">6 scholarships</strong> for students entering trade school</li></ul><p id="">By supporting not only traditional four-year college pathways but also trade programs and advanced degrees, the city is laying the groundwork for a diverse and skilled workforce that meets the demands of today’s economy. Several past scholarship recipients have already returned to work in Atlantic City, contributing their talents to the local government and business community.</p><h3 id="">#InvestinAC: Community-Funded, Future-Focused</h3><p id="">This scholarship program represents more than a generous giveaway. It’s a strategic investment in long-term prosperity. When residents are equipped with education and job training, they are more likely to stay in the city, launch businesses, purchase homes, and give back to their community. That kind of growth doesn’t just benefit individuals, it uplifts entire neighborhoods.</p><p id="">With nearly 300 applications submitted this year, the program's rising popularity is proof that Atlantic City residents are eager for opportunity. The selection committee, composed of trusted local leaders, carefully reviews applications and essays to ensure that scholarships go to those most ready to make an impact.</p><p id="">As Mayor Small noted, while this marks the final year of the original three-year commitment, efforts are already underway to ensure the program continues. In Atlantic City, investing in the next generation isn’t a short-term promise. It’s a long-term plan.</p><p id=""><strong id="">#LiveinAC | #WorkinAC | #InvestinAC | #GreatDayAtlanticCity</strong></p><p id="">‍</p>

<p id="">Pennsylvania Avenue School proudly held its 8th Grade Stepping Up Ceremony on Friday, June 13, 2025, in the school’s cafetorium. With the theme “Dare to Shine: Destined for Greatness,” the celebration honored the students’ hard work, growth, and the journey ahead as they move into high school.</p><p id="">The ceremony was filled with inspiring messages of resilience, determination, and kindness—values deeply rooted in the Pennsylvania Avenue School community. Educators, families, and students gathered in support of the Class of 2025, applauding not only academic milestones but also the strength and character built over time.</p><p id="">Principal Thomas Biggins opened the program with a speech encouraging students to lead with kindness and work hard. He reminded students that “excellence doesn’t mean being perfect,” but instead showing up, trying again, and building strong habits. His words underscored the importance of perseverance, urging students to keep striving—even when the path ahead is challenging.</p><p id="">“Keep grinding,” Biggins said. “Your hard work will open doors you can’t even see yet.” He also emphasized that compassion and empathy are the hallmarks of true leadership. “Being kind makes you strong,” he said. “It makes you a leader, not a follower.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6851788be0900e813f639419_IMG_8814.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id=""><strong id="">Salutatorian Ayana Frierson</strong> </figcaption></figure><p id="">Salutatorian Ayana Frierson delivered a moving speech about balancing academics and athletics.

It means giving your best, even when it’s tough.” Her story highlighted dedication and gratitude, and she credited her community—teammates, coaches, family, and teachers—for their support.</p><p id="">Frierson reflected on nights when she studied for science tests after long practices, showing that greatness is a matter of choice and mindset. “Every foul taught me to play fair. Every ‘try again’ taught me to push harder,” she said, reminding her peers to embrace both the struggle and the lessons.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685178a5e9c4e5becc55ca23_IMG_8827.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id=""><strong id="">Valedictorian Joendy Viola Pimentel</strong></figcaption></figure><p id="">Valedictorian Joendy Viola Pimentel captivated the audience with his story of perseverance.

Her reflections emphasized that growth often comes through failure, and that self-compassion is essential in times of uncertainty.</p><p id="">As the ceremony came to a close, students walked across the stage with their certificates in hand, cheered on by loved ones. Their smiles and proud expressions signaled a bright future ahead—one defined not by perfection, but by courage, effort, and a commitment to shine.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit to: <strong id="">Mark Tyler, District Communications Specialist</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[Atlantic City’s Clean Communities Initiative returned for summer 2025, allowing residents to earn money while cleaning up their neighborhoods. The program offered a $200 monthly stipend to groups that participated in regular cleanups through October.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City’s Clean Communities Initiative officially wrapped its fourth consecutive summer of promoting neighborhood pride and environmental stewardship. Led by the Department of Public Works, the program returned in 2025 and once again provided local residents with the opportunity to earn money while actively improving their own communities.</p><p id="">Throughout the summer, the Public Works Department rotated through different Atlantic City wards daily, conducting neighborhood cleanups and inviting the public to join the effort. This hands-on program was designed to inspire civic responsibility and a cleaner, safer Atlantic City for all. Residents responded with enthusiasm and a shared commitment to the cause.</p><p id="">Groups of five or more were invited to participate by committing to clean at least four blocks twice a month. In return, these groups received a $200 monthly stipend, making the initiative a win-win: residents benefited financially while the city saw a significant reduction in litter and debris. Participants were provided with trash bags, gloves, grabbers, and safety vests to ensure an efficient and safe cleanup process.</p><p id="">The program also emphasized accessibility. Interested residents were able to collect applications at the Public Works Office in Room 604 at City Hall, where they also received further instructions. All inquiries during the program period were directed to Clean Communities Coordinator Angela Pittman.</p><p id="">The 2025 initiative officially ran through October 1, 2025, giving residents a full summer to take part. The city’s website, <a target="_new" href="http://www.acnj.gov" id="">www.acnj.gov</a>, hosted the initial daily cleanup schedule and other updates throughout the season, allowing participants to stay informed and engaged.</p><p id="">Beyond the monetary incentive, many participants cited a sense of pride and ownership in their neighborhoods as the most rewarding aspect. The program succeeded in not only cleaning the streets but also in strengthening bonds between neighbors and fostering a collective sense of responsibility.</p><p id="">This summer’s Clean Communities program also served as a platform for youth engagement. Several local youth groups and student organizations joined in, turning their summer break into a meaningful community service experience.</p><p id="">City officials expressed satisfaction with the turnout and effectiveness of the program. They noted that litter levels were visibly reduced and public response was overwhelmingly positive, setting the stage for continued growth of the initiative in future years.</p><p id="">The 2025 program demonstrated that with a shared goal and a small incentive, community transformation is achievable. Atlantic City residents once again showed that they are ready and willing to step up for the betterment of their neighborhoods.</p><p id="">‍</p>

]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">On June 5, 2025, the City of Atlantic City, in partnership with the State of New Jersey, proudly celebrated the grand opening of the Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver Plaza. Located outside City Hall, this new space was named in honor of the late Lieutenant Governor, a trailblazer who left a lasting mark on New Jersey’s political and civic landscape.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr. led the ribbon-cutting ceremony alongside New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Commissioner Jaquelyn Suarez, members of Sheila Oliver’s family, and a gathering of City, County, and State officials. The event marked both a celebration of legacy and the completion of a major public space renovation.</p><p id="">This project not only paid tribute to Lt. Governor Sheila Oliver but also significantly improved the public’s experience at City Hall. The main entrance, closed since construction began in spring 2024, was reopened with a covered walkway and a new security gate, enhancing both convenience and safety.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68430170415f895084493a57_504188450_1024861109828358_8295916882888555672_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">Further security upgrades included improved lighting across the courtyard, with lanterns added to the exterior walls, and reconfigured main and employee entrance doors to streamline access and safety. Sheila Oliver’s name, now prominently etched above the entrance walkway, along with her image and signage throughout the plaza, added a powerful visual tribute.</p><p id="">The plaza also received extensive aesthetic improvements. Visitors can now enjoy built-in benches, a thoughtfully designed rain garden, an elegant marble fountain, and a pergola that brings charm and shade to the space. Lush new trees, shrubs, and grass were planted to soften the urban setting and create a welcoming environment.</p><p id="">The building itself received attention as well. Existing exterior walls were power washed and repainted, restoring their original brightness and contributing to the refreshed look and feel of the City Hall complex.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6843018d8174a929c167fb94_504183632_1024861116495024_5997697757120594477_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">To make the plaza more walkable, pedestrian space was expanded across the courtyard. These wider walking paths made the area more accessible and navigable for visitors, staff, and residents passing through the site.</p><p id="">In addition to the courtyard renovations, the City Hall parking lot was repaved and redesigned. A new parking attendant booth was installed at the South Carolina Avenue entrance, further improving visitor management and traffic flow.</p><p id="">Lastly, in line with the city’s growing commitment to renewable energy, six Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations were scheduled to be installed later in the month—adding a forward-thinking, sustainable element to the site.</p><p id="">The opening of the Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver Plaza marked more than the completion of a construction project—it symbolized respect for a remarkable leader and a renewed vision for civic space in Atlantic City. The plaza now stands as a lasting reminder of her legacy and the city’s dedication to accessibility, safety, and sustainability.</p><p id="">‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Photo Credits to: <strong>Ed Lea / City of Atlantic City</strong></p>

<p id="">The 12th Annual Boat Races at Atlantic City High School were a resounding success, drawing cheers from classmates, teachers, and visitors as students put their engineering and physics knowledge to the test on the water.</p><p id="">Held on campus in Atlantic City, NJ, this year’s event celebrated creativity, teamwork, and scientific application through one of the school’s most exciting traditions. Students from Honors Physics and AP Physics 1 classes participated, using principles they learned throughout the year to design and race their boats across a makeshift course.</p><p id="">The competition was not only about speed, but also about design, buoyancy, and innovation. Every team had the opportunity to present their vessels, explain their engineering choices, and demonstrate how physics could be applied in a practical, hands-on challenge.</p><p id="">The highlight of the event came when a new school record was set by Zuzanna Turska ’25, a two-time champion, and her teammates. Their boat sped across the finish line faster than any in previous years, cementing their names in the school’s physics legacy. Their victory proved to be a perfect blend of technical skill and effective collaboration.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842ffa1d843c8bd4da564c2_503858217_18228357895293165_3238898973631612657_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">The first-place prize went to “Puff Mobile”, created by students in the Honors Physics class. Known for its sleek design and aerodynamic efficiency, the boat outpaced its competitors while remaining remarkably stable during the race.</p><p id="">Second and third place were awarded to “Armstrong” and “Mayflower”, both entries from AP Physics 1. These boats demonstrated unique structural solutions and a deep understanding of force, motion, and fluid dynamics.</p><p id="">The event was as educational as it was entertaining, giving students the chance to engage with physics in a way that was both interactive and memorable. Teachers and spectators alike were impressed by the ingenuity on display and the energy students brought to the challenge.</p><p id="">The race also served as an opportunity for students to practice problem-solving, collaboration, and communication, all key components of STEM education. Whether their boats placed or not, every participant walked away with valuable experience and a sense of pride.</p><p id="">A big thank you went out to all who came to support the event, especially the teachers who organized it and the students who made it possible. The 12th Annual Boat Races stood as a testament to what students can achieve when given the space to explore, build, and compete.</p><p>‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit to: <strong>Atlantic City High School</strong></p>

<p id="">The Chelsea Heights School Spring Music Showcase was a vibrant celebration of student musicianship, held on June 5, 2025. Families and faculty gathered to witness the culmination of months of preparation, as students took the stage to demonstrate their dedication, creativity, and passion for music.</p><p id="">The school's cafetorium was transformed into a performance venue filled with energy and applause.

Students cheered for their peers, creating a supportive and enthusiastic environment that echoed throughout the afternoon.</p><p id="">The event featured a wide range of musical performances, offering something for everyone. The showcase opened with the school’s violin students, who performed “Go Tell Aunt Rhody” and “Song of the Wind.” These selections, drawn from the Suzuki Violin School, Volume 1, were played with focus and charm, setting a warm tone for the rest of the program.</p><p id="">Adding a contemporary touch to the event, a clarinet trio delivered a well-received rendition of the pop hit “Sweater Weather.” Their performance brought a modern flair to the showcase, highlighting the students' versatility and musical adaptability.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842fd32389b4f7ec289d3d7_503978613_1244191427710607_3289813678651566052_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">A trumpet quartet followed with a delightful version of “London Bridge.” The familiar tune prompted audience members to hum along, creating a shared moment between performers and listeners. The nostalgic melody paired with the students’ disciplined playing made the piece both fun and impressive.</p><p id="">One of the most memorable moments of the afternoon was an original student composition titled “Dreamless Inspiration.” This piece, performed by a mixed-instrument quartet of violin, percussion, trombone, and clarinet, stood out for its innovative arrangement and emotional depth. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause, recognizing the creativity and collaboration behind the performance.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842fdd23a22f5b31eb171bc_494103572_1244191437710606_1801011572780609749_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">Instrumental Music Teacher Patrick Angelo, in his first year at Chelsea Heights School, expressed deep pride in the students’ efforts. “A lot of effort has been put in. Students have been taken out of classes for practice and rehearsals,” he shared. “They’ve worked tirelessly, and their dedication really shines through in their performances.” Angelo supported his students throughout, often joining them in rehearsal while ensuring they remained the stars of the show.</p><p id="">Principal James Knox praised Angelo’s leadership and impact in his first year. “He has done a marvelous, fantastic job for his first year,” Knox said. “I’m sure all of the teachers can remember that first year—I sure can.” His remarks underscored the success of the showcase as a team effort and a testament to strong arts instruction.</p><p id="">The Spring Music Showcase served as more than just a school concert—it was a shining example of how music education can empower students with confidence, discipline, and self-expression. As the final note faded and the applause settled, it was clear that the event had left a lasting impression on both the performers and the audience.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit to: <strong id="">Mark Tyler, District Communications Specialist</strong></p>

<p id="">The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School Complex in Atlantic City recently hosted a lively and unforgettable event — MLK Fun Day 2025 — that brought students, staff, and the community together for a full day of celebration, fun, and connection.</p><p id="">Serving both as a reward for students who excelled throughout the year and encouragement for those needing a boost, the day reflected the school’s commitment to both achievement and inclusivity. Principal Jodi Burroughs shared that the main goal was to allow kids to enjoy themselves in a safe and supportive environment.</p><p id="">“The beauty of this is that kids get to be kids and have fun in a safe space,” said Burroughs.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842fb237b3280b2898f7429_503473336_1242607724535644_8320311423337272003_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Seventh and eighth graders enjoyed a unique treat: access to the newly renovated Pop Lloyd Stadium, where a spirited kickball tournament brought out the best in student teamwork and athletic energy. The stadium buzzed with cheers and laughter as students ran bases, competed with pride, and supported their peers.</p><p id="">Back on school grounds, the school yard was transformed into a vibrant carnival-style playground, complete with inflatable bouncy houses, slides, popcorn, and snow cones. A variety of sports stations gave students the chance to test their skills, while music from a DJ added rhythm and energy to every corner of the event.</p><p id="">Inside the auditorium, creativity and fun took center stage. Students participated in interactive games like Paper Dragon, which challenged them to unroll ribbons using arm circles within 60 seconds, and Dizzy Mummy, where teams of two wrapped each other in toilet paper without breaking it. These games highlighted the students' creativity, agility, and sense of humor.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842fb2dd392a0f972253dee_503259866_1242607781202305_3949650415119002223_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">A standout element of this event was its cost-free experience for all participants. Thanks to student-led fundraising efforts, including book fairs and popcorn sales held throughout the school year, Fun Day was entirely funded without placing any burden on students or families.</p><p id="">“They pay for nothing, and it’s all because of their fundraising,” said Burroughs. “They did small book fairs, popcorn sales and other things. Fun Day is great because it encourages them to do well.”</p><p id="">With high energy, laughter, and unity, MLK Fun Day 2025 left lasting memories for students and staff alike. It stood as a testament to the school’s dedication to recognizing effort, fostering community, and making space for students to simply be kids.</p><p id=""><br>Photo Credit to: <strong>Mark Tyler, District Communications Specialist</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[The Atlantic City High School girls and boys crew teams delivered a dominant performance at the Atlantic County Crew Championships, capturing the combined team points title and several individual and group victories. The event marked a historic day for the program and highlighted its rising strength.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City High School girls and boys crew teams made an indelible mark on Sunday, May 11, 2025, by winning the combined team points title at the Atlantic County Crew Championships, held at Lake Lenape in Mays Landing. It was a defining moment for a program that had been steadily climbing back to prominence in recent seasons.</p><p id="">The girls team captured the highest points trophy of the meet, a reflection of consistent excellence across multiple events. Coach Sean Duffey praised the squad for their work ethic and dedication. “We put a lot of time in out on the water, and it’s great to see it pay off at the end of the year when it counts,” he said. Duffey called it the most significant day in the school’s history at the Atlantic County races.</p><p id="">A major highlight was the girls varsity eight crew’s commanding victory in the 1,500-meter race, finishing in just 5 minutes, 11.6 seconds. The lineup — Mardiha Ahmed, Katelynn Do, Maggie Morgan, Zuzanna Turska, Anna Tran, Jodi-Lynn Pereira, Lauren Fox, stroke Lexi Gormley, and coxswain Tasnova Tayeba — demonstrated unmatched synchronization and strength, achieving the program’s first-ever win in that event.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1170px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1170px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/682cbbc38cd6a50186f6cda2_492482251_1227523129377437_3727826833055312164_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The day’s success extended beyond a single race. The girls freshman eight clinched a win, signaling that the program’s future remains bright. Meanwhile, the girls varsity second eight added to the medal tally, reinforcing the team’s competitive depth.</p><p id="">Individual prowess also shone through. The girls varsity single sculler brought home a win, showcasing strength and resilience. In another strong performance, the girls varsity quad boat finished first, adding yet another feather to the team's cap.</p><p id="">Not to be outdone, the boys crew team contributed significant victories. The boys second varsity four raced to a win, while the boys novice eight also claimed first place — a testament to the hard work of athletes and coaches alike.</p><p id="">Behind the team’s resurgence was a major investment from the Atlantic City Board of Education, which provided six brand-new Vespoli High Performance Series racing boats, along with new oars and team apparel. The equipment upgrade, revealed in a March 26, 2024 ceremony, helped elevate the program after years of using aging gear.</p><p id="">The new Vespoli boats, with their carbon fiber hulls, wing rigger systems, and custom paintwork, gave ACHS rowers a competitive edge. Coach Duffey noted the significant improvements in both practice and performance. “It was significantly easier to manage practice and races as we were not repairing older, worn-out boats daily,” he said.</p><p id="">This year’s championship victory built on momentum from the previous season, when the girls team won the Junior Eight category at the 2024 Scholastic Rowing Association of America National Championship. With growing numbers, renewed investment, and historic wins under their belt, the ACHS crew teams signaled a powerful comeback and a bright future.</p><p id="">‍</p>

<description><![CDATA[Atlantic City celebrated Small Business Month with the launch of the ‘Keep it Local’ campaign and a day of FREE CITYWIDE STREET PARKING on May 17 to boost support for local businesses. The initiative highlighted the city’s dedication to making small business growth both accessible and visible.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The City of Atlantic City officially recognized May as Small Business Month, launching impactful initiatives designed to support local entrepreneurs and boost the city's economic vitality. Mayor Marty Small Sr. issued a proclamation declaring the celebration, reaffirming the city's commitment to its small business community.</p><p id="">At the center of the month-long campaign was the launch of the ‘Keep it Local’ initiative, a citywide effort encouraging residents and visitors to Shop, Eat, Explore in Atlantic City. Spearheaded by the Department of Planning &amp; Development, the campaign aimed to drive foot traffic to local establishments and raise awareness of the diverse businesses that make up the city’s commercial landscape.</p><p id="">Businesses across Atlantic City were provided with eye-catching signage in six vibrant colors—each representing one of the city’s six wards. These signs were placed in storefront windows to show support for the ‘Keep it Local’ message. Participating businesses were also featured on the city’s promotional website, <a target="_new" href="http://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com" id="">www.greatdayatlanticcity.com</a>, providing added visibility to both residents and tourists.</p><p id="">To further incentivize public engagement, the city declared FREE CITYWIDE STREET PARKING on Saturday, May 17, 2025. Parking meters and kiosks across the city, with the exception of beach block areas, were not enforced, making it easier for people to visit and shop locally. The initiative was a strategic move to remove barriers to access and encourage greater patronage of Atlantic City’s small businesses.</p><p id="">The city’s efforts extended beyond marketing and convenience. The Small Business Academy, a free educational program offered by the city, concluded its latest cohort this month. Residents participated in business pitch sessions and received training on how to start and grow their own businesses—equipping them with essential tools for success.</p><p id="">Additional free programs such as “How to Do Business with Atlantic City” were also made available to residents, offering guidance on navigating city processes and unlocking opportunities for growth and collaboration.</p><p id="">Another important focus was the revitalization of Atlantic Avenue, where the city continued developing a comprehensive incentive package to attract diverse retail businesses, particularly those not currently represented in the community. These efforts aimed to enhance the avenue’s vibrancy and make it a hub for both residents and visitors.</p><p id="">In collaboration with Community Development Corporations (CDC’s) and the Atlantic City Metropolitan Business and Citizens Association (MBCA), the city worked to amplify the impact of the ‘Keep it Local’ campaign. These organizations provided grants, mentorship, and resources to support aspiring entrepreneurs.</p><p id="">Throughout Small Business Month, Atlantic City underscored its commitment to empowering local businesses through access, visibility, education, and strategic investment. By aligning public initiatives with private-sector goals, the city created a model for community-driven economic development.</p>

<p id="">The <strong id="">Atlantic City Free Public Library</strong> took another step toward community enrichment with the unveiling of its newest <strong id="">Little Library</strong> at <strong id="">Brown’s Park</strong>. The ribbon-cutting took place on May 8 during the <strong id="">Midtown Atlantic City CDC’s Spring Community Event</strong>, a gathering that brought neighbors together to celebrate growth and connection in Midtown.</p><p id="">The new <strong id="">Little Library</strong> stands as a vibrant symbol of literacy, accessibility, and community spirit. Filled with books for all ages and interests, it encourages visitors to take a book or leave one, making it easier for everyone—especially families and children—to access reading materials close to home.</p><p id="">This initiative was part of the Library’s broader effort to promote reading beyond the walls of its main branch. By placing these small, self-serve book hubs in parks and neighborhoods, the library hopes to inspire more people to develop a love of reading in their everyday environments.</p><p id="">The addition of the <strong id="">Little Library</strong> was made possible by generous funding from the <strong id="">Foundation of the Atlantic City Free Public Library</strong>, <strong id="">AtlantiCare</strong>, and the <strong id="">Midtown CDC</strong>. Their combined support ensured not just the installation of the unit, but also its continued maintenance and restocking.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1536px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1536px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68235c579c1e2d997204645b_497639994_1095998382561901_7989877470423686064_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Throughout the afternoon, families stopped by to browse the shelves, pick out books, and talk with library staff about upcoming programs and services. Children’s laughter echoed through the park as they explored the new addition, already making it a cherished neighborhood feature.</p><p id="">Representatives from all three funding partners were present, highlighting the collaborative nature of the project. They emphasized how partnerships between nonprofits, health organizations, and civic groups are essential to building stronger, more informed communities.</p><p id="">The <strong id="">Atlantic City Free Public Library</strong> has long been committed to outreach and inclusion, and the launch of this <strong id="">Little Library</strong> is just the latest example of that mission in action. It not only provides a practical resource but also fosters a sense of pride and ownership within the neighborhood.</p><p id="">As the event wound down, visitors left with books in hand and smiles on their faces. The success of the launch demonstrated the impact that small, thoughtful investments can have in shaping a more connected and literate Atlantic City.</p><p id="">Looking ahead, the library plans to expand its <strong id="">Little Library</strong> program to other neighborhoods, ensuring that the joy of reading reaches every corner of the city. With continued support from community partners, this initiative will serve as a long-lasting resource for residents of all ages.</p><p id="">Photos Credit: Atlantic City Free Public Library</p>

<description><![CDATA[On May 8th, aspiring Atlantic City entrepreneurs presented their business ideas after completing the 10-week Small Business Academy. The program gave participants tools, guidance, and confidence to turn their business dreams into action.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The energy at Simpson’s Restaurant on Thursday, May 8th, was undeniable as aspiring entrepreneurs from across Atlantic City stepped up to pitch their business ideas to a panel of judges. These participants had just completed the Small Business Academy, a free, intensive 10-week program designed to empower local residents with the knowledge and resources to launch or expand their own businesses.</p><p id="">The room was filled with excitement, nerves, and hope. Each participant had spent weeks immersed in the fundamentals of business operations, from financial planning and branding to market research and growth strategies. The academy was led by Bruce Weekes and Pam Fields of the City of Atlantic City’s Planning and Development Department, in collaboration with the African American Chamber of Commerce of New Jersey.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6824cd872f27abefb5e8419f_496921618_1007320041582465_6710847756447384099_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">The pitch competition served as the culmination of everything the participants had learned. Presenters shared their vision in front of a panel made up of local business owners and investors, offering not only feedback but potential support and partnerships. Some participants came in with existing businesses they wanted to scale, while others were presenting a brand-new concept for the first time.</p><p id="">The ideas were as diverse and vibrant as the city itself, ranging from new restaurants to mom-and-pop shops to innovative service-based businesses. No matter the concept, each pitch reflected a shared determination: to contribute something valuable to the local economy and community.</p><p id="">The Small Business Academy wasn’t just about education, it was about empowerment. For many participants, this was their first time standing in a room of professionals and publicly expressing a business vision. The confidence they displayed was a testament to the strength of the program and the support they received along the way.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr., who created the academy several years ago, has long championed initiatives that support local development and economic opportunity. His vision for the academy was simple but impactful: give Atlantic City residents real tools to help them succeed in the competitive world of business.</p><p id="">The evening highlighted how much potential exists when communities invest in their own people. The judges, visibly impressed, offered constructive feedback, mentorship opportunities, and in some cases, real interest in funding or supporting the pitches they heard.</p><p id="">While not every idea may launch tomorrow, the seeds were clearly planted. Participants walked away not only with experience, but with momentum and a network of mentors, peers, and advocates cheering them on.</p><p id="">In the weeks and months ahead, many of these aspiring entrepreneurs will take the next steps in making their ideas a reality. Thanks to the Small Business Academy, they’ll be doing it with knowledge, confidence, and community backing.</p><p id="">The future of Atlantic City’s small business landscape looks brighter than ever, powered by passion, preparation, and people ready to build something great.</p>

<description><![CDATA[The Police Unity Tour made a moving stop in Atlantic City on May 12th, bringing together law enforcement officers and surviving families to honor those who gave their lives in the line of duty. The city stood still as riders arrived in solemn unity and deep respect.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Every year, the Police Unity Tour brings together riders from across the country—men and women in law enforcement, along with survivors of line-of-duty deaths—for one deeply meaningful mission: to honor their fallen colleagues. This year was no different, and on May 12th, at exactly 2:00 PM, the tour made a poignant stop in Atlantic City, drawing the attention and admiration of the community.</p><p id="">The streets were lined with residents and supporters who came out to witness a moment of collective remembrance. What made this gathering powerful was not just the presence of flashing lights or the formation of bicycles rolling in—it was the silent, unspoken connection among the riders and the families they ride for. Every face in the crowd reflected a mix of solemnity, pride, and gratitude.</p><p id="">The Police Unity Tour isn’t just about a bike ride—it’s about carrying a legacy forward. Each participant rides in memory of someone lost too soon, many wearing badges or patches displaying the names of those they honor. As they moved through Atlantic City, you could feel the weight of every mile they had already covered, and the purpose behind every pedal stroke.</p><p id="">After their arrival, the riders were welcomed with a brief but heartfelt ceremony. Speakers from the tour organization, local government, and survivor networks shared words that resonated deeply with everyone present. The message was simple yet powerful: those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty will never be forgotten.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/682354a837fde59dfe78c89d_496798359_1128085936014796_2878241981442932233_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">One of the most touching moments came when families of fallen officers were invited forward. Their stories were short, but each one painted a vivid picture of courage, commitment, and love for service. The crowd stood in respectful silence as names were read, and the memory of each officer was brought to life again through stories, smiles, and even tears.</p><p id="">The event also served a broader purpose beyond remembrance. The Police Unity Tour raises awareness and funds for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and Museum in Washington, D.C., ensuring that these stories are preserved for generations to come. The riders’ dedication to the cause reminded everyone that honoring the past also means educating the future.</p><p id="">Atlantic City has long stood as a symbol of strength and resilience, and hosting the Police Unity Tour only reinforced that spirit. The city's officials, including Mayor Marty Small Sr., extended their gratitude to the participants and emphasized the city’s unwavering support for its public servants and their families.</p><p id="">What lingered after the crowd dispersed wasn’t just the memory of flashing lights and uniforms, but the emotional impact of unity. For many in attendance, especially those who have lost someone in the line of duty, it was a day of healing and connection. It reminded everyone that they are not alone.</p><p id="">As the tour continued on its journey, Atlantic City was left with a deep sense of appreciation and honor. The moment may have passed, but the message remained: service is never forgotten, and sacrifice is always remembered.</p><p id="">The Police Unity Tour left an indelible mark not just on the streets of the city, but on the hearts of all who witnessed it.</p><p id=""><strong>‍</strong></p><p id="">Photo Credit: Atlantic City PBA&nbsp;Local #24</p>

<description><![CDATA[Atlantic City High School collected over 30 pints of blood during its spring blood drive on May 7, 2025, highlighted by Derek Santos making a Power Red donation. Students’ efforts directly helped those in need and inspired future community involvement.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City High School American Red Cross Blood Drive made an impressive impact on May 7, 2025, with students coming together to support a life-saving cause. One standout contribution came from junior Derek Santos, who went beyond a standard blood donation by making a Power Red donation, collecting two units of red blood cells in a single appointment.</p><p id="">Derek Santos was inspired by his biomedical science class, where he had been learning the intricacies of drawing blood. Motivated by a challenge from his teacher, he embraced the opportunity, saying, “It’s a cool opportunity. I feel like I did my good deed for the day.” His action exemplified how young people can make a significant difference through small, courageous steps.</p><p id="">A Power Red donation differs from a traditional blood donation by returning platelets, plasma, and saline to the donor after collecting the red blood cells. Although the process took longer, it was twice as effective in terms of impact, making Santos’s donation even more meaningful.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1258px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1258px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6822240697adaf74ddd0d252_Screenshot%202025-05-13%20003758.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The blood drive was organized by Jaclyn Sarnese and Bryan Scheeler at Atlantic City High School. Jaclyn Sarnese, a biomedical science teacher, emphasized that the students should feel proud of their participation, as their efforts would directly help people in urgent need. Bryan Scheeler, the Red Cross Club advisor, noted that Atlantic City High School traditionally held blood drives each winter and spring.</p><p id="">This year’s spring event surpassed expectations, with students donating more than 30 pints of blood, outdoing the collection from the previous January blood drive. The overwhelming response demonstrated the students' generosity, compassion, and community spirit.</p><p id="">Scheeler also expressed hope that student volunteers would gain valuable insight into the broader work of organizations like the American Red Cross and recognize future opportunities for involvement and service.</p><p id="">The successful event proved that when students are given the right encouragement and opportunities, they can come together to achieve something truly remarkable. Atlantic City High School once again showed that service and education go hand in hand.</p><p id="">The Atlantic City High School American Red Cross Blood Drive served as a shining example of student leadership, volunteerism, and commitment to saving lives.</p>

<description><![CDATA[The City of Atlantic City celebrated Small Business Month in May 2025 by launching initiatives such as the Free Parking on May 17 event and the ‘Keep it Local’ campaign. These efforts were designed to promote local businesses and boost the city’s economy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In honor of National Small Business Month, the City of Atlantic City officially celebrated Small Business Month throughout May 2025. Mayor Marty Small Sr. delivered a proclamation affirming the city's commitment to supporting local businesses and boosting the local economy.</p><p id="">The Department of Planning &amp; Development, under the leadership of Assistant Director of Economic Development Bruce Weekes and Principal Community Organizational Specialist Pam Fields, launched a series of initiatives designed to empower small businesses across Atlantic City. Their efforts demonstrated the city’s dedication to creating a thriving environment for entrepreneurs and local commerce.</p><p id="">On May 17, 2025, the city offered Free Parking on May 17, waiving parking fees at meters and kiosks throughout Atlantic City, except on the beach blocks. This initiative encouraged both residents and visitors to explore the city and support neighborhood businesses without the concern of parking fees.</p><p id="">The city also introduced the ‘Keep it Local’ campaign, featuring colorful signage encouraging people to ‘Shop, Eat, Explore’ Atlantic City. Each sign’s color represented one of the city's six wards. Businesses that displayed the signage were featured on the city’s newly launched website — <a target="_new" href="http://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com" id="">www.greatdayatlanticcity.com</a> — further boosting their visibility.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/682211a4458ce6a283377201_495218773_1005167801797689_3494406814623415321_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The Small Business Academy continued to provide free education and training for Atlantic City residents interested in launching or expanding their businesses. The latest cohort graduated in May 2025, and participants showcased their business pitches at The Simpson Restaurant and Bar.</p><p id="">In addition to the academy, the city offered other valuable free programs, such as “How to Do Business with Atlantic City,” helping residents understand the processes and resources available to them.</p><p id="">As part of a larger revitalization effort, the city worked on a comprehensive incentive package to encourage new businesses to open along Atlantic Avenue. The goal was to increase vibrancy, attract businesses currently lacking in the area, such as a hardware store — and enhance the overall experience for residents and visitors.</p><p id="">The City of Atlantic City also strengthened community partnerships by collaborating with local Community Development Corporations (CDCs) and the Atlantic City Metropolitan Business and Citizens Association (MBCA). These organizations provides grants and resources to help new businesses get their start, reinforcing the city’s mission to grow a robust, local economy.</p>

Founder of the museum, which operates locations in both Atlantic City and Buena Vista Township, he has built one of the region’s most important cultural institutions from the ground up. What began as a personal passion project has evolved into a collection of more than 33,000 pieces, documenting the lives, legacies, and contributions of African Americans throughout South Jersey and beyond.</p><p id="">Only 5% of the collection is on display at any given time. Imagine that decades of Black history, hidden in plain sight.</p><p id="">Mr. Hunter’s journey began with a curiosity and a sense of responsibility. His early experience working with renowned collector Herman Blum planted a seed, and by 2002, that seed grew into the opening of the first African American Heritage Museum in Newtonville. The Atlantic City branch followed, now housed in the Noyes Arts Garage of Stockton University, where thousands of visitors, local and global, come to learn about the rich heritage of the city’s Black community.</p><p id="">From artifacts and photographs to rare memorabilia, each item in the museum has a story and Mr. Hunter knows many of them by heart. He has welcomed over 20,000 visitors annually through the doors of the museum and reached more than 100,000 students through his mobile museum exhibits, which travel across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York.</p><p id="">"People say to me, 'We didn’t know there was any history in Atlantic City,'" Mr. Hunter shared. His mission has always been to change that.</p><p id="">This commitment to truth, education, and cultural preservation is why Mr. Hunter is honored with the 2025 Spirit of Hospitality Award by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA). It is a recognition long overdue for a man who has given so much of himself to ensure others never feel forgotten.</p><p id="">As Mr. Hunter shared in his video spotlight, "More and more people have to learn that when they come to a town like Atlantic City, to learn the history. And that’s what we do here at the African American Heritage Museum."</p><p id="">We are proud to feature Mr. Hunter on Great Day Atlantic City to ensure that his contributions are shared, celebrated, and remembered.</p><p id="">‍</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">With cheers from the community and pride from city leaders, Pop Lloyd Stadium officially reopened on Tuesday following a $5.6 million renovation that transformed the historic site into a vibrant, multi-sport facility for future generations.</p><p id="">The ribbon-cutting ceremony marked not just the reopening of a field, but the revival of a legacy. Named in honor of Hall of Famer and Negro League legend John Henry “Pop” Lloyd, the stadium now stands as a living monument to both Atlantic City’s deep-rooted Black history and its ongoing investment in community.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small Sr., joined by local officials and residents, addressed the crowd at home plate with heartfelt conviction. He shared that the vision for this transformation began on November 8, 2019, when he first committed to turning the aging stadium into a state-of-the-art, multi-purpose complex.</p><p id="">“This is a gift for the community,” he said.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6812364866a808dea527dc91_Pop%20Lloyd002_24%20(1).jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small, Pedro Sierra, Ron Jordan</figcaption></figure><p id="">‍</p><p id="">The renovation, funded largely through the American Rescue Plan, replaced overgrown grass and a deteriorated infield with a gleaming navy blue artificial turf, accented with bright red infield markings. The revitalized stadium now features new bleachers, dugouts, lighting, a scoreboard, sound system, locker rooms, restrooms, and fencing. It is equipped to host baseball, softball, flag football, and other sports, serving local residents while attracting regional play.</p><p id="">“This is how government should work,” said Councilman Kaleem Shabazz. “Pop Lloyd is part of American history. If there wasn’t segregation and discrimination, he would’ve been a Major League star. This stadium is not just a baseball field, it’s part of our country’s history. We have a solemn duty to tell his story and preserve this legacy.”</p><p id="">Born in 1884, John Henry “Pop” Lloyd was one of the greatest shortstops in Negro League history. After his playing career, he worked as a custodian in Atlantic City’s public schools and was remembered for his humility, mentorship, and enduring presence in the community.</p><p id="">Ron Jordan, 90, a longtime resident and Indiana Avenue School alum, recalled meeting Lloyd in his youth.</p><p id="">“As time went on, I learned just how much he contributed to baseball,” Jordan said, noting that he later visited the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., to see Lloyd’s plaque.</p><p id="">Jordan then introduced Pedro Sierra, 86, a former Negro Leagues pitcher from Cuba who also played in the minor leagues for the Minnesota Twins and Washington Senators.</p><p id="">“I’m thankful for all the men who came before me and opened doors for players like me,” Sierra shared.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/681235fe52cc8a524c15ebfd_Pop%20Lloyd002_33%20(1).jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Councilman Aaron "Sporty" Randolph, Councilwoman Stephanie Marshall, Pedro Sierra, Ron Jordan, William “Speedy” Marsh<strong id="">, </strong>Councilman Kaleem Shabazz</figcaption></figure><p id="">‍<br></p><p id="">The relaunch of Pop Lloyd Stadium is part of Mayor Small’s broader strategy to reinvest in Atlantic City’s public assets. Just weeks ago, the city celebrated the reopening of the Atlantic City Aquarium, another revitalization project funded by the federal COVID-19 relief package.</p><p id="">City Business Administrator Anthony Swan reminded attendees that stewardship is key to sustainability. “We spent a lot of time, money, and effort to bring this to the community. Let’s protect it.”</p><p id="">For Mike Griffin, Director of Recreation, the reopening held deep personal meaning. “I grew up riding my bike past this stadium, watching casino leagues play, and even playing ball here as a student,” he said.<br>“Now I get to oversee this field for the next generation. It’s a full-circle moment.”</p><p id="">Since Mayor Small declared the stadium “open for business,” Griffin said the Recreation Department has been flooded with calls. The first event—a high school baseball game between Atlantic City and Oakcrest—is scheduled for Thursday, May 1st. Adult softball leagues and other recreational programs will follow this summer.</p><p id="">“This is going to be something that doesn’t exist anywhere else in South Jersey,” Griffin said.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68123586bb20b2c977665669_pop%20lloyd%20exterior.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">The revamped facility is now a vibrant hub for baseball, football, soccer, and more.</figcaption></figure><p id="">‍</p><p id="">The reopening of Pop Lloyd Stadium restores a beloved landmark, honors the past, and opens new doors for Atlantic City’s future.

<p id="">The City of Atlantic City is seeing real progress in public safety. According to newly released data from the Atlantic City Police Department (ACPD), overall crime in the city has dropped by more than 11% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024—another strong signal that the Small administration’s investments in safety and technology are delivering results.</p><p id="">The statistics, sourced from the New Jersey State Police Offense Report, show declines across every major crime category:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Crimes Against Persons</strong> (including homicide, assault, and sex offenses) are down <strong id="">22.28%</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Crimes Against Property</strong> (including robbery, burglary, and theft) have decreased by <strong id="">4.3%</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Crimes Against Society</strong> (including drug offenses, weapons offenses, and prostitution) are down <strong id="">4.48%</strong></li></ul><p id="">In total, Group "A" Offenses fell from 1,427 in Q1 2024 to 1,266 in Q1 2025—an <strong id="">11.28% decrease</strong> overall.</p><p id="">Perhaps most significantly, there were <strong id="">zero homicides reported in the first quarter of 2025</strong>, compared to six during the same time last year. Non-fatal shooting incidents are also down. The ACPD investigated <strong id="">just three shooting cases in 2025</strong>, versus eight similar incidents in early 2024—a <strong id="">62.5% reduction</strong>.</p><p id="">“There's this exaggerated narrative that Atlantic City is not clean and safe, but the facts and data tell a different story,” said Mayor Marty Small, Sr. “The Atlantic City Police Department keeps showing why they are the best police department in the world. Whether it’s added manpower, new equipment and technology, or promotions, my administration will continue to support law enforcement in every way possible to keep this downward trend in crime going.”</p><p id="">ACPD responded to <strong id="">24,733 calls for service</strong> in the first quarter of 2025—averaging 274 calls per day. That’s a notable decrease from the 26,523 calls for service during the same period in 2024. Arrest totals have remained steady: 1,159 individuals were charged in Q1 2025, nearly identical to last year’s 1,161. However, <strong id="">juvenile arrests have increased</strong>, rising from 36 in 2024 to 67 in 2025.</p><p id="">Ongoing initiatives like the <strong id="">Citywide Surveillance Camera Project</strong>—now two-thirds complete—are strengthening the city’s crime-fighting tools.

Mayor Small Unveils 2025 Budget with Continued Tax Reduction and Investor Confidence for Atlantic City

<description><![CDATA[Atlantic City is charting a new course—and delivering real results. This week, Mayor Marty Small Sr. announced the sixth consecutive property tax decrease for Atlantic City residents, cementing a powerful trend of financial responsibility and resident-focused governance. Unveiled during a news conference at City Hall, the 2025 City of Atlantic City budget includes a 3.4-cent tax rate reduction—a move that not only keeps money in residents’ pockets, but also sends a clear message: this administration is putting people first.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id=""><strong id=""><em id="">Six straight years of tax decreases reflect strong leadership, community investment, and growing economic momentum.</em></strong></p><p id="">Atlantic City continues to chart a new path forward—one defined by fiscal responsibility, transparency, and a deep commitment to the people who call it home. This week, Mayor Marty Small Sr. announced the sixth consecutive municipal property tax decrease, part of a $258 million city budget that prioritizes both community needs and long-term financial strength.</p><p id="">The 3.4-cent tax rate cut in the 2025 budget follows years of strategic planning and disciplined budgeting under the Small administration, and is a clear reflection of the city’s core focus: putting residents first while ensuring Atlantic City is a place where families can thrive, businesses can grow, and investors can feel confident.</p><p id="">“This administration is keeping its promise by making the city’s taxpayers its number one priority,” Mayor Small shared during a news conference at City Hall. “Once again, Atlantic City is a leader when it comes to fiscal responsibility.”</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Real Relief, Strategic Spending</strong></h3><p id="">The 2025 budget includes $258 million in municipal spending, and when including grant funds, totals nearly $280 million. The budget also includes a full payoff of the city’s debt service for the year—a move made possible by years of careful financial management.</p><p id="">According to Chief Financial Officer Toro Aboderin, the city now holds a $78 million surplus, $28 million of which will be used to fund the 2025 budget. The budget also allocates $27 million toward capital improvements, including street paving and building repairs—delivering visible, on-the-ground benefits to Atlantic City residents.</p><p id="">Perhaps even more remarkable: the city’s outstanding debt has dropped from $550 million in 2019 to $328 million today, showing how far the city has come since state oversight began under the 2016 Municipal Stabilization and Revitalization Act.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">State Support Driving Down the Levy</strong></h3><p id="">One key piece of Atlantic City’s financial turnaround has been its access to Investment Alternative Taxes (IATs)—taxes collected from casino gaming revenues that are now used to help pay down municipal debt. In 2024, the city received over $68 million in IAT funding, thanks to reforms that redirected these revenues from the CRDA back into the city’s general operations.</p><p id="">As a result, Atlantic City’s tax levy has plummeted—from $128 million in 2015 to just $34 million today. Meanwhile, the tax collection rate has improved from roughly 95% in 2019 to 98.1% in 2025—a testament to growing public trust and consistent city leadership.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Credit Ratings and Investor Outlook on the Rise</strong></h3><p id="">This momentum has not gone unnoticed. In September, Moody’s Ratings upgraded the city’s long-term issuer rating to Ba2, while Standard &amp; Poor’s raised its rating to BB+. Atlantic City is now just one step away from investment-grade status—a critical milestone that could unlock new funding opportunities and strengthen the city’s ability to attract developers and anchor institutions.</p><p id="">Mayor Small and his finance team, including Business Administrator Anthony Swan, Budget Officer Tom Monoghan, and partners from the Department of Community Affairs, say they are laser-focused on keeping the progress going.</p><p id="">“We’re continuously finding ways to get more money and make our financial situation better,” Small said. “With the plethora of development projects scheduled to come online next year, we’re going to be in a great place to have another tax decrease.”</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Why It Matters</strong></h3><p id="">For residents, six years of steady tax relief means Atlantic City is becoming a more affordable place to live and raise a family. For businesses and entrepreneurs, it signals smart, stable governance and ongoing investment in infrastructure, safety, and growth. And for investors watching from afar, it’s another reason to believe in Atlantic City’s transformation.</p><p id="">From balancing budgets to backing bold development initiatives like Bader Field, Mayor Small’s administration is demonstrating what it means to lead with both fiscal discipline and a community-first vision.</p><p id="">‍</p>

<description><![CDATA[The City of Atlantic City held its first Daddy Daughter Sneaker Ball, where proud dads and beaming daughters shared a night full of joy, dancing, and unforgettable memories. Organized by AC Rec and city partners, the evening was truly magical.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id=""><em id="">A new tradition focused on family, connection, and community pride.</em></p><p id="">When Mayor Marty Small Sr. took office in 2019, he made a promise to create more opportunities for families to come together, celebrate one another, and feel connected to the city they call home. That promise was on full display at Atlantic City’s All Wars Memorial Building during the inaugural Daddy Daughter Sneaker Ball, an event that many hope will become a new Atlantic City tradition.</p><p id="">Organized by the Atlantic City Recreation Division, the Sneaker Ball was a refreshing twist on the traditional father-daughter dance—offering an experience that prioritized fun, fashion, and family. The free event welcomed fathers and father figures from across Atlantic City to attend with their daughters, walking the red carpet, posing for photos, and dancing the night away in outfits that mixed formal flair with comfortable sneakers.</p><p id="">Inside the beautifully decorated venue—thanks to the Mayor’s Office of Special Events—guests enjoyed dinner, desserts, “mocktails,” and giveaways donated by generous local businesses and community partners. These touches reinforced the heart of the event: community support and connection.</p><p id="">While the Recreation Division is known for its sports leagues and youth programs, events like this reflect its broader mission to create meaningful moments that bring people together. Recreation Director Mike Griffin shared that more events like this are already being planned, in addition to the division’s ongoing after-school programming and seasonal trips designed to keep Atlantic City youth active, inspired, and engaged.</p><p id="">Since the Mayor’s first term, Atlantic City has continued to invest in programming that brings joy, promotes unity, and helps families create memories close to home. These types of initiatives speak to a broader goal—making Atlantic City a place where people can thrive, raise their families, find opportunity, and take pride in where they live.</p><p id="">The success of the first-ever Daddy Daughter Sneaker Ball proves that Atlantic City residents are ready to celebrate one another in new ways—and that the city is just getting started. These moments of joy and connection are what make Atlantic City a great place to live, work, and invest.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Want more good news in your inbox?</strong>‍</p><p id="">‍<strong id="">Sign up for the Great Day Atlantic City newsletter</strong> to stay up to date on events, progress, and community wins that showcase the best of Atlantic City.</p>
