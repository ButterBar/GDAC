<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The holiday season is all about giving — and once again, the <strong>Atlantic City Police Department</strong> is helping make the season brighter for local families through its annual <strong>Shop With A Cop</strong> program.</p><p>Kicking off on <strong>December 15</strong>, the three-day initiative brings together Atlantic City police officers, children, and community partners for a meaningful holiday experience rooted in kindness, connection, and support. The 2025 program is being held at <strong>Walmart in Egg Harbor Township</strong> in partnership with <strong>O.C.E.A.N., Inc.</strong> and <strong>Walmart</strong>.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1294px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1294px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/694092d16b96ae3649548abe_Screenshot%202025-12-15%20175912.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><h3>Building Joy — and Trust — One Shopping Trip at a Time</h3><p>Each day from <strong>9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.</strong> (December 15, 16, and 17), participating children are paired <strong>one-on-one with Atlantic City police officers</strong> for a special holiday shopping experience. Together, they browse the aisles, pick out gifts, and share conversation — creating moments that are both joyful and meaningful.</p><p>More than just a shopping trip, <strong>Shop With A Cop</strong> is designed to foster positive relationships between youth and law enforcement in a relaxed, welcoming environment. By spending time together outside of traditional law-enforcement settings, officers and children have the opportunity to connect on a personal level — building trust and understanding that can last well beyond the holidays.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1348px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1348px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6940929153e95e22c1fb5152_Screenshot%202025-12-15%20175753.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><h3>A Tradition Rooted in Community Care</h3><p>Shop With A Cop has long been a cherished community initiative in Atlantic City. Officers volunteer their time to participate, reflecting a shared commitment to supporting families and showing young people that law enforcement is deeply invested in their well-being.</p><p>With the support of partners like <strong>O.C.E.A.N., Inc.</strong> and <strong>Walmart</strong>, the program helps ensure that children and families can experience the joy of the season while feeling seen, supported, and valued.</p><h3>Spreading Holiday Spirit Across the City</h3><p>As Atlantic City continues to celebrate the season through parades, markets, and community events, <strong>Shop With A Cop</strong> stands out as a powerful reminder of the impact that compassion and collaboration can have.</p><p>It’s moments like these — small in scale but big in heart — that define what it means to be a community. And once again, Atlantic City is showing that the holidays are about more than gifts; they’re about connection, care, and coming together.</p><p>‍</p>

<description><![CDATA[November was a month of revitalization, celebration, and community pride in Atlantic City. From major infrastructure upgrades to cultural recognition and heartfelt local events, the Great Day Gazette captured how the city continued to grow stronger together.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AtlanticCityGov" id=""><strong id="">City of Atlantic City</strong></a> continued its revitalization efforts this November, focusing on infrastructure, community connection, and celebration. Major updates, new programs, and heartwarming stories shaped another <strong id="">great month</strong> in the city’s journey toward progress and unity.</p><p id="">The city’s infrastructure saw significant improvements as Pacific Avenue joined the paving program, aligning with the ongoing Atlantic Avenue repaving project. The initiative was strengthened by a total of $5.3 million in NJDOT grant funding, supporting road enhancements and synchronized traffic signal upgrades across key corridors. Additionally, $684,708 was allocated for new pedestrian sidewalks along the Black Horse Pike, improving safety for students and families traveling between Atlantic City High School and Chelsea Heights.</p><p id="">Progress was also visible in other neighborhoods. The Baltic Avenue paving project neared completion, while the MLK Boulevard upgrade moved into the milling and paving phase. Meanwhile, construction reviews were underway for the Atlantic Avenue paving from Tennessee to Albany Avenues—marking another milestone in the city’s ongoing development plan.</p><p id="">Community spaces also came back to life with the long-awaited grand opening of Weekes Memorial Park. After years of careful restoration, this park once again became a welcoming gathering space for residents. The redesign featured landscaping, artistic displays, sustainable features, and accessibility upgrades, symbolizing the city’s commitment to safety, inclusion, and green living.</p><p id="">Listening to resident feedback, the Public Works Department installed additional stop signs at Winchester and Dover Avenues to ensure improved pedestrian and traffic safety—another example of how the city acted on community input to enhance neighborhood well-being.</p><p id="">The city celebrated the season with family-friendly festivities. Harvest Town filled Gardner’s Basin with music, games, costumes, and community resource tables, bringing together families for an afternoon of fun and connection. Likewise, Senior Services hosted a pumpkin decorating event, adding creativity and color to the fall spirit.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1080px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1080px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/690cd2e961cd3b661040eab9_Screenshot%202025-11-07%20004526-Picsart-AiImageEnhancer.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">Fall evenings came alive at Bader Field during the Drive-In Movie &amp; S’mores Night, where families gathered under the crisp night sky to enjoy a family film, fires, and free refreshments. The event also provided free winter hats and gloves, ensuring everyone stayed warm while celebrating together. Meanwhile, Atlantic City Recreation wrapped up another successful T-ball season, helping young athletes learn teamwork and skill in a positive environment.</p><p id="">Acts of heroism and recognition took center stage this month as well. The Atlantic City Police Foundation Hero Luncheon honored Sgt. Jonathan Walsh for saving a swimmer from drowning and Treasurer James Kutch for his years of dedicated service. During the same period, Officer Matt Schmidt received national attention for rescuing an injured canine from the icy October bay waters, showcasing the bravery and compassion of the city’s first responders.</p><p id="">Atlantic City also paid tribute to Rita and Anthony Mack, longtime business owners and community leaders, by dedicating a section of Arctic Avenue in their honor. For nearly four decades, the Macks provided employment, mentorship, and opportunities to countless residents through their McDonald’s franchises, making a lasting impact on the community they loved.</p><p id="">The city’s diversity and unity were celebrated as Mayor Marty Small Sr. and the Office of Multicultural Services received the Diaspora Excellence Award from Rediscover Africa 2025 and the Ghanaian Associations of South Jersey and Atlantic City. The recognition reflected the city’s ongoing commitment to cultural inclusion and the success of historic events like the Ghana Flag Raising Ceremony—the first of its kind in New Jersey.</p><p id="">November also emphasized health and wellness through the Pink Walk for a Purpose, a citywide event for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, where employees joined together to walk in support of survivors and ongoing fighters. Meanwhile, the Re-Entry Services Division held a family reunification event at the All Wars Memorial Building, providing food, fun, and creative activities that brought families closer together.</p><p id="">Finally, Atlantic City Youth Services launched an empowering martial arts program, teaching children the 3 S’s—Self-confidence, Self-reliance, and Self-defense—as part of a series of exciting fall programs designed to engage the city’s youth in positive growth and discipline.</p><p id="">From infrastructure renewal and community celebrations to acts of heroism and cultural recognition, November 2025 stood as another milestone month for Atlantic City—reminding everyone that every day truly is a Great Day in Atlantic City.</p>

She addressed seasonal illnesses and emerging health concerns such as Hand, Foot and Mouth disease, reinforcing the importance of prevention and early awareness.</p><p id="">“Nurse Price leads with empathy and care,” said Principal Biggins. “Bringing awareness to everything that a nurse does is absolutely critical.”</p><p id="">The event’s welcoming environment was further enriched by the efforts of Parent Resource Center Educator Denise Bowles, who highlighted the center’s role in supporting families. “We take care of the needs of the parents,” Bowles said, explaining that the center offers English as a Second Language (ESL) classes and family-centered programs like Muffins with Moms and Donuts with Dads.</p><p id="">Waffles with the Nurse was more than just a breakfast gathering—it was a celebration of community, health, and collaboration. The event reflected the district’s dedication to supporting families not only academically but also through wellness and engagement initiatives.</p><p id="">Through events like this, Atlantic City Public Schools continues to strengthen the partnership between educators, health professionals, and families, ensuring that every child has the foundation to thrive in both health and learning.</p><p id="">The success of Waffles with the Nurse demonstrated how meaningful outreach and genuine connection can foster stronger relationships, encourage proactive health habits, and build a more supportive school community.</p><p>‍</p><p>Photo Credit: <strong id="">Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City community has been lovin’ longtime Atlantic City McDonald’s owners Rita and Anthony Mack for the last four decades, and they’ve been lovin’ the community right back. And now, the City of Atlantic City has honored these two community icons with a street dedication recognizing their nearly 40 years of business excellence, community impact, and entrepreneurial leadership in the city.</p><p id="">Arctic Avenue between Michigan and Arkansas Avenues has been named <em id="">Rita and Anthony Mack Avenue</em>, paying tribute to the couple who owned and operated multiple McDonald’s franchises in Atlantic City, with their first one purchased in June 1986 and final one sold in May 2024 as they embarked on a much-deserved retirement.</p><p id="">The Macks are the definition of successful entrepreneurship in Atlantic City. Long before casinos dominated the city’s economy, there was a generation of African American business leaders who built strong, community-based enterprises that anchored neighborhoods and provided opportunity. Today, as Atlantic City’s Economic Development division under the Department of Planning and Development works to revitalize that same spirit of local ownership and empowerment, the Macks stand as living proof that businesses –especially minority-owned ones - can not only survive but thrive in Atlantic City. Rita and Anthony Mack have been the blueprint for success, showing what’s possible through hard work, generosity, and a deep commitment to community.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68fa511a331427c439d9baf0_Mack%E2%80%99s%20Street%20%20_85.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small presents the Macks with a version of their street sign to take home (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">“We really appreciate your many years of service, your selfless service, and your dedication to the Great City of Atlantic City community," Mayor Small told the Macks during the Street Dedication Ceremony in their honor. It was during this ceremony that the couple also received a custom street sign to take home, symbolizing the enduring legacy they have built.</p><p id="">Rita and Anthony Mack expressed deep gratitude for the recognition and for the community that supported them from the beginning.</p><p id="">“We are incredibly honored and humbled to receive this awesome recognition,” said Rita Mack. “The renaming of this city block to <em id="">Rita and Anthony Mack Avenue</em> is an undeniable dream for us. It’s the very block where we began our business journey in 1986, and we are thrilled beyond belief.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:4305px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="4305px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68fa5195b15ae74d2e622535_Mack%E2%80%99s%20Street%20%20_73.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Rita Mack speaking during the Street Dedication Ceremony in her and huer husband's honor (Credit: Edward Lea / city of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">Reflecting on their journey, Rita added:</p><p id="">“They say the most critical factors in choosing a franchise are location, location, location. I must say, we struck gold when we purchased our Arkansas Avenue site. But we were also blessed to find ourselves in a supportive and caring community. From the very beginning, this community has embraced and supported us in so many ways.”</p><p id="">The Macks hope that others — especially young people and aspiring entrepreneurs — will be inspired each time they pass <em id="">Rita and Anthony Mack Avenue</em>, a lasting reminder that dreams can be built right here in Atlantic City. </p><p id="">Their name now rightfully takes its place in the heart of Atlantic City in recognition of their extraordinary contributions. </p><p id="">‍</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Get ready to taste something new in Atlantic City! Starting November 1, 2025, the city will officially launch its food truck operations at two popular public destinations—Gardner’s Basin and O’Donnell Memorial Park—bringing more dining variety, energy, and opportunity to the community.</p><p id="">Approved unanimously by City Council earlier this year, this initiative reflects Atlantic City’s growing commitment to supporting small businesses and enhancing its outdoor spaces. The Office of Economic Development and Department of Planning &amp; Development have been working closely with Public Works and Licensing &amp; Inspection to prepare each site with new signage, designated vendor spaces, and clear operating guidelines to ensure a smooth launch.</p><p id="">At O’Donnell Memorial Park, food trucks will be positioned along Captain John O’Donnell Parkway, offering easy access for residents and visitors exploring the area. Meanwhile, at Gardner’s Basin, trucks will operate along the roadway between the Seawall parking lot and the Atlantic City Aquarium, providing guests with convenient and delicious options by the water.</p><p id="">Each location will accommodate up to eight registered and approved food trucks, operating daily from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Interested vendors can now apply through the City of Atlantic City website at <a target="_new" href="http://www.acnj.gov" id="">www.acnj.gov</a>. Applications open on October 6, 2025, under the Licensing &amp; Inspection section—simply select <em id="">Food Truck</em> under <em id="">Business Licenses/Mercantile</em>.</p><p id="">“This is another exciting step in showing that Atlantic City is open for business,” said Mayor Marty Small, Sr. “We’re creating opportunities for small businesses, generating tax revenue, and giving residents and visitors more affordable food options in two of our most visited public areas.”</p><p id="">Bruce Weekes, Assistant Director of Economic Development, added, “Residents have asked for this for years—and we listened. Our goal is for this program to serve as a stepping stone for food operators to establish themselves right here in Atlantic City, grow their brands, and eventually open permanent storefronts.”</p><p id="">All participating food trucks will be inspected and approved by the City of Atlantic City Health Department and the Atlantic City Fire Department before operation. Vendors will be responsible for maintaining cleanliness and following all city regulations. Please note that the sale of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis is strictly prohibited.</p><p id="">With this new initiative, Atlantic City continues to prove that it’s not just a destination—it’s a community of opportunity, where entrepreneurs can thrive and residents can enjoy diverse, local experiences every day.</p>

<p id="">The momentum continues. In another milestone for Atlantic City’s infrastructure revitalization, Mayor Marty Small Sr., joined by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), announced the full repaving of Pacific Avenue — one of the city’s most vital transportation corridors — as part of more than $25 million in ongoing infrastructure projects across the city.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68ef9e6cabd206c961faa46b_561546674_1132001329114335_634555109041630840_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">$5.3 Million in New Grant Funding Fuels Major Improvements</strong></h3><p id="">The <strong id="">New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)</strong> recently awarded <strong id="">$5.3 million</strong> in new State and Federal grant funding to support several significant projects in Atlantic City, including the full repaving of <strong id="">Pacific Avenue</strong> and the construction of <strong id="">new sidewalks</strong> connecting <strong id="">Atlantic City High School</strong> and <strong id="">Chelsea Heights</strong> — a key safety improvement for students and families.</p><p id="">This funding builds on more than <strong id="">$25 million in active infrastructure projects</strong> already underway citywide, including improvements along <strong id="">Atlantic Avenue, Baltic Avenue, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, and Tennessee Avenue</strong>.

These grants are helping us transform Atlantic City’s infrastructure, while also making critical safety improvements that benefit everyone.”</p><p id="">“The revitalization of Pacific Avenue has been a priority for Governor Murphy and now that the signal synchronization is under contract, it is important to repave this major corridor from Maine Avenue to Albany Avenue,” said NJDOT Commissioner <strong id="">Fran O’Connor</strong>. “This is the gateway to the casino resorts, hotels, businesses, and famed Boardwalk.

What began as an internal newsletter has grown into a dynamic publication that celebrates everything that makes Atlantic City an extraordinary place to live, work, and thrive.</p><p id="">The rebrand comes at an exciting time, aligning with the launch of the Great Day Atlantic City app—a digital platform designed to shine a light on the people, progress, and positive news happening across the city. Together, the Gazette and the app form a powerful communication hub, keeping residents, employees, and visitors informed about all the great things taking place within Atlantic City.</p><p id="">In his opening message, Mayor Marty Small Sr. expressed enthusiasm for the Gazette’s evolution and the city’s renewed focus on positivity and transparency. “There are way too many negative voices out there when it comes to the Great City of Atlantic City,” the Mayor said. “The Great Day platform gives all the positives, which far outweigh the negatives—the spotlight they deserve.”</p><p id="">This month’s issue of the Great Day Gazette is packed with inspiring stories, community highlights, and exciting updates. Readers can look back on the success of <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com/news/positive-culture-shift-for-atlantic-city-employees-continues-with-mayor-smalls-great-day-event" id=""><strong id="">Great Day 2025</strong></a>, a day of motivation and team building for city employees dedicated to the memory of Chief of Staff Ernest Coursey. The event featured keynote speaker Nehemiah Davis, who encouraged city staff to focus on growth, resilience, and becoming the best versions of themselves.</p><p id="">The Gazette also covers the city’s presence at the first Atlantic City Strategic Communications Summit, hosted by Stockton University and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA). There, the city’s Marketing Team—including Public Information Officer Andrew Kramer, Assistant PIO Adele Polk, Shennita Williams, and Ziggy Chau of Lucky PR—presented Great Day Atlantic City as a leading example of civic storytelling and community engagement. The summit emphasized collaboration and shared messaging across local institutions to build a stronger, unified voice for Atlantic City.</p><p id="">Readers will also find updates on major development and infrastructure projects. Mayor Small joined community leaders for the grand opening of The Seahaus Hotel and Cucina Del Mar, celebrating the continued growth of Atlantic City’s hospitality sector. Meanwhile, the city began the long-anticipated revitalization of Atlantic Avenue—a transformative project that includes new paving, traffic signal upgrades, ADA-compliant ramps, enhanced lighting, and beautification improvements designed to make the corridor safer and more welcoming for all.</p><p id="">Economic opportunity and small business growth are also front and center. The Gazette highlights the Small Business Micro Grant Program, providing reimbursement support for local businesses through federal ARPA funding, and the new food truck program opening two prime locations—Gardner’s Basin and O’Donnell Memorial Park—to bring affordable dining options and entrepreneurial opportunities to the community.</p><p id="">In Public Safety News, the friendly rivalry between the Atlantic City Fire Department and Police Department took center stage during the first-ever Mayor’s Cup Softball Game. The community gathered at Pop Lloyd Stadium to cheer on both teams, celebrating camaraderie and civic pride. The issue also recognized newly promoted fire officers and honored the city’s first responders during the Atlantic City 9/11 Memorial Ceremony.</p><p id="">The Gazette continued its tradition of celebrating people and programs that make Atlantic City vibrant—from Senior Appreciation Day and Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations at City Hall, to new youth initiatives including the Youth Theater Program, Girl Scouts sessions, and Little Leapers gymnastics. Each story reflected the city’s ongoing mission to create inclusive, engaging opportunities for all residents—young and old alike.</p><p id="">Looking ahead, the issue also shared details on upcoming events that embody the city’s community spirit, including the Flood Safety Workshop, the Roll Out! Skating Party for National Coming Out Day, the Drive-In Movie &amp; S’mores Night at Bader Field, and the much-anticipated Harvest Town Festival at Gardner’s Basin.</p><p id="">As the city continues to evolve, the Great Day Gazette stands as a symbol of connection and collaboration—highlighting the stories that too often go untold and celebrating the everyday efforts that make Atlantic City stronger. Whether it’s infrastructure progress, employee recognition, or community celebration, the Gazette captures it all.</p><p id="">Mayor Small summed it up best: “No other administration in Atlantic City history has given employees the amount of training, recognition, and opportunity they’re getting right now—and that’s something I’ll never let up on.”</p><p id="">Read the full October 2025 issue of the Great Day Gazette to stay informed, inspired, and connected to the city’s latest achievements and upcoming events. Because here in Atlantic City—every day truly is a Great Day.</p><p id="">‍</p><h5 id=""><strong id="">To view the full version of October 2025 Great Day Gazette, click here:</strong> <a href="https://www.acnj.gov/_Content/pdf/Great-Day-Gazette-October-2025.pdf">View the newsletter</a>‍</h5>

Florida Avenue, purchased her property last year. Since then, she has had a front row seat to watch the area transform for the better and credits the improvement in safety as a key factor in her ability to grow her event planning business.</p><p id="">“In the beginning, those of you who know about Florida Avenue, it was a nightmare,” she said. “I went to Mayor Small’s office, and I explained the situation to him, and he addressed it with the Atlantic City Police Department, and every time I called his office, he helped me out, so I thank him for helping get Florida Avenue cleaned.”</p><p id="">With a renewed sense of security, Claud has been able to turn Love Caters All into a full-service business offering planning, decoration, and venue space for weddings and events — especially for clients looking for last-minute solutions.
