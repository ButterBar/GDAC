<p id="">Atlantic City made history with the launch of its first-ever <strong id="">Black Business Expo</strong>, a dynamic celebration of entrepreneurship and community collaboration. Held at the historic All Wars Memorial Building on August 26, 2025, the expo brought together Black-owned business vendors, local officials, and residents in honor of <strong id=""><em id="">National Black Business Month</em></strong>. The event served as a platform for local entrepreneurs to showcase their goods and services, gain exposure, and access vital resources designed to help their businesses grow.</p><p id="">Among the enthusiastic vendors was Ruschele Whitfield, owner of <em id="">Fitness Foodies</em>, a health-focused brand that promotes wellness through nutritious snacks and products.</p><p id="">“I’m grateful that the city arranged such a meaningful event for all entrepreneurs, especially Black entrepreneurs,” Whitfield said. “Small business ownership is not easy. So when you have a chance to elevate your business, you need community and motivation. We’re all excited to buy, sell, and learn here.”</p><p id="">The expo featured panel discussions with both emerging and established business leaders, live radiobroadcasts promoting local brands, and a curated art exhibit led by Atlantic City historian Ralph Hunter. In addition, attendees had the opportunity to apply for micro-grants aimed at supporting business development.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width=""><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68af6501709841fdaf511f0b_Black%20Expo_7.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Attendees getting to shop around and support Black businesses set up as vendors</figcaption></figure><p id="">For vendors like Samantha Prescott, founder of <em id="">Nana’s Pudding</em>, the experience was about more than just sales.</p><p id="">“This is a great marketing and networking event,” Prescott said. “The room is full of information and resources. It was great to be a part of it!”</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small Sr. addressed the hundreds of attendees, highlighting the importance of Black-owned businesses to the city’s economic future. He pointed out how previous administrations had long overlooked this part of the community—but that changed under the Small administration.</p><p id="">“There was a time when our city was home to hundreds of Black-owned businesses,” added Bruce Weekes,<strong id=""> </strong>the City of Atlantic City’s Assistant Director of Economic Development and co-organizer of the expo. “Today, that number has dwindled to just dozens. We see this expo as a launching pad to help restore the strong presence Black businesses once had in our community.”</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68af66d6f5c84cdfc2c83b81_Black%20Expo_17.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Bruce Weekes welcoming attendees to the Atlantic City Black Business Expo</figcaption></figure><p id="">The expo was organized by the city’s Economic Development team, led by Weekes and Pam Fields, in collaboration with the Planning &amp; Development Department and with strong support from Mayor Small, who made several major announcements during the event:</p><ul id=""> <li id=""><strong id="">A $500,000 commitment in grant funding to support Black-owned businesses in Atlantic City.</strong></li> <li id=""><strong id="">The launch of "Great Day &nbsp;University" this fall, a free financial wellness program for &nbsp;residents offering credit repair and financial planning.</strong></li> <li id=""><strong id="">A promise to bring the Black Business Expo back next year, making it an annual tradition.</strong></li></ul><p id="">The event also marked the release of the Atlantic City Black Business Directory, a new resource thatlists Black-owned businesses across the city by category, complete with contactinformation - a tool designed to promote visibility and encourage localsupport.

<h4 id=""><em id="">"Marketing is not always about money, it’s about momentum."</em></h4><p id="">That is just one of the many criticallessons presented to a room full of local entrepreneurs during a free marketing seminar offered by the City of Atlantic City Economic Development division of the Planning &amp; Development department.</p><p id="">“Coffee and Conversation: Marketing Without Any Money” drew a full crowd at Beat the Grind Café—a fitting location, as the small business itself has benefited from some of the same guidance now being shared.

<description><![CDATA[Mayor Marty Small Sr. joined The Weather Channel to discuss Atlantic City’s storm preparation, highlighting flood-prone areas, beach erosion concerns, and safety measures for residents and tourists.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">As storm conditions continue to affect the Jersey Shore, Mayor Marty Small Sr. joined The Weather Channel’s Reynolds Wolfe to discuss Atlantic City’s readiness, the challenges of flooding, and the city’s commitment to keeping residents and visitors safe.</p><h3 id="">A City Prepared for the Storm</h3><p id="">Despite the threat of strong winds, high surf, and coastal flooding, Mayor Small opened the interview with confidence: <em id="">“Despite the storm, it’s a great day here in the City of Atlantic City. My administration is prepared from the beach patrol to emergency management, to police, to fire, to public works. We’ve got a little bit of experience in this.”</em></p><p id="">The Mayor pointed to several flood-prone neighborhoods of particular concern, including Bungalow Park, Venice Park, Chelsea Heights, and Fairmount Avenue, where moderate flooding was expected around 7:42 PM high tide. While the city projected water levels of 7.6 feet—well below the 10.9 feet recorded during Hurricane Sandy—officials emphasized caution.</p><h3 id="">A Call for Safety</h3><p id="">Mayor Small highlighted both residents and tourists in his message: <em id="">“This is an international destination, the great city of Atlantic City. And as mayor, I’m responsible for the health, welfare, and safety of the residents and the tourists. It’s heed to our warnings. It is very dangerous.”</em></p><p id="">With powerful waves attracting onlookers and surfers, city officials urged the public to avoid risky behavior and remain cautious. Sustained winds of <strong id="">45 mph with gusts up to 55 mph</strong> were expected overnight, compounding the risk of coastal flooding and rip currents.</p><h3 id="">Concerns Over Beaches</h3><p id="">One of the Mayor’s biggest concerns was the potential loss of beaches on the north end of Atlantic City, home to major resorts including Hard Rock, Ocean, Resorts, and Showboat. The Army Corps of Engineers had recently completed a replenishment project, but storm erosion threatened to undo much of the progress. <em id="">“We’re just hoping to salvage some of the beach for the last two weekends of the summer,”</em> the Mayor said, noting that further discussions with federal partners may be needed once the storm passes.</p><h3 id="">A Long Season Ahead</h3><p id="">Asked how the city stays prepared during a long Atlantic hurricane season, Mayor Small compared the challenge to football, proudly invoking his hometown team: <em id="">“It’s just like my football team, the world champion Philadelphia Eagles, which is going to win it again. We’re prepared here—be it events like this, blizzards, nor’easters, and more. We’ve got the professional team to execute and weather the storm.”</em></p><h3 id="">Looking Forward</h3><p id="">While conditions were expected to improve with clearer skies over the weekend, rip currents and flooding risks remain top concerns.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City has long been known for its casinos, boardwalk, and bustling entertainment scene—but one small business has been changing that narrative with bold flavors and culinary innovation. This year, Tony Boloney’s Atlantic City and its spinoff, Mad Mutz Laboratory, were awarded the Innovation Award as part of the City of Atlantic City’s <em id="">“Keep It Local”</em> campaign.</p><p id="">The award was presented by the city’s <strong id="">Economic Development Division</strong> under the Department of Planning &amp; Development, highlighting the critical role that small businesses play in shaping Atlantic City’s identity and strengthening its local economy.</p><h3 id="">From a Convenience Store to a Culinary Institution</h3><p id="">When founder Mike Hauke opened Tony Boloney’s in 2009, the business began as a modest convenience store. But it wasn’t long before Hauke shifted gears, transforming the space into a restaurant that pushed boundaries with imaginative pizzas, sandwiches, and mozzarella creations.</p><p id="">Known for its playful, over-the-top menu, Tony Boloney’s quickly became a destination for food lovers. One of its biggest hits—the flavored mozzarella sticks—was not only a fan favorite but also the spark that inspired Hauke to launch Mad Mutz Laboratory, a dedicated brand built around producing these mozzarella sticks on a larger scale.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1678px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1678px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a8b272ea2daec5515eaf1b_Screenshot%202025-08-23%20015250.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Mad Mutz Laboratory: From Atlantic City to Global Stage</h3><p id="">With the creation of Mad Mutz Laboratory, Hauke and his business partner Michael Burns took a local favorite and elevated it into a product with national and international appeal. Their inventive mozzarella sticks even landed them on ABC’s <em id="">Shark Tank</em>, a milestone that further propelled the brand’s recognition and reach.</p><p id="">What began as a neighborhood eatery has now grown into a globally recognized food brand, demonstrating how a mix of creativity, risk-taking, and dedication can fuel long-term growth and success.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1829px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1829px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a8b282f8f259b3aa01bf1d_Screenshot%202025-08-23%20015303.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Recognized for Innovation</h3><p id="">At the award ceremony, Mayor Marty Small Sr. personally honored Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory, issuing a proclamation that praised the businesses as role models for future entrepreneurs.</p><p id="">“Therefore, I, Mayor Marty Small Sr., Mayor of the great city of Atlantic City, hereby recognize Mad Mutz’s Mozzarella Laboratory for being a role model for future entrepreneurs in the great city of Atlantic City and wish this business continued success both locally and now globally.”</p><p id="">For Hauke, the recognition was deeply meaningful. He described it as “a welcoming surprise” to be honored by the city and proud to see both his and Michael Burns’ work celebrated with the Innovation Award.</p><h3 id="">A Community Built on Creativity</h3><p id="">The story of Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory reflects more than just the rise of a successful business. It highlights the power of innovation in Atlantic City’s small business community and how creative entrepreneurs can help redefine the city’s culture and reputation.</p><p id="">The “Keep It Local” campaign is designed to showcase businesses like Hauke’s that bring something fresh and unexpected to the community, proving that Atlantic City is about more than its casinos—it’s also about flavor, passion, and originality.</p><h3 id="">Looking Ahead</h3><p id="">With a strong foundation built on innovation, national recognition, and global reach, Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory continue to set the bar for what’s possible when big ideas meet local pride. For Hauke and his team, the journey from a convenience store in 2009 to winning an <strong id="">Innovation Award in 2025</strong> is proof that Atlantic City’s entrepreneurial spirit is alive and thriving.</p><p id="">‍</p><h4 id=""><strong id="">#InvestinAC #LiveInAC #WorkInAC</strong></h4>

<p id="">Atlantic City once again witnessed the power of tradition and community last Friday as thousands gathered for the annual Wedding of the Sea Festival, a celebration that honors the city’s long-standing bond with the ocean.</p><p id="">The day began with a special Mass held at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City, drawing residents, visitors, and community leaders together in prayer and reflection.

Mayor Marty Small Sr.’s Op-Ed in NY Daily News Puts Atlantic City’s Lessons on the National Stage

<description><![CDATA[In the New York Daily News op-ed, Mayor Marty Small Sr. draws on more than four decades of Atlantic City’s experience with gaming to send New York a clear message: if casinos are coming, they must be built to serve the people who live there, not just the developers. Reflecting on both the promises and pitfalls of Atlantic City’s own history, Mayor Small urges New York to pair gaming with long-term investments in housing, infrastructure, small businesses, and community programs — the kind of strategies that have fueled Atlantic City’s recent resurgence.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. is taking the city’s story, and its hard-earned lessons, straight to one of the nation’s largest media markets.</p><p id="">In an opinion piece in the <em id="">New York Daily News</em> published on the August 15th, Mayor Small weighed in on New York’s high-stakes push to license three new downstate casinos. Drawing from more than four decades of lived experience in America’s original East Coast casino town, he issued a clear challenge: if New York is going to build casinos, they must serve the people who live in those neighborhoodsnot just the developers who profit from them.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1080px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1080px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a32a5e995b3a0c7c6dc0cf_GDAC%20Social%20Media%20Post.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">‍</p><h2 id=""><em id="">“Casinos alone don’t build cities. People do,” Mayor Small wrote.</em></h2><p id="">‍</p><p id="">The Mayor’s piece pulls no punches in recalling Atlantic City’s own history. While gaming brought thousands of middle-class jobs and kept city services running, it also displaced families, erased neighborhoods, and failed to deliver the full promise of reinvestment. The lesson, he says, is that casinos must be part of a broader, long-term plan that includes housing, small business support, infrastructure upgrades, and economic diversification.</p><p id="">Mayor Small contrasted New York’s current licensing process, with Coney Island, the Bronx, and Queens among the proposed sites against Atlantic City’s own efforts to strengthen its economy beyond gaming. In recent years, the city has cut property taxes for six straight years, reopened the Atlantic City Aquarium, restored the historic Pop Lloyd Stadium, and secured $50 million to rebuild the Boardwalk and repair streets.</p><p id="">Initiatives like <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com"><strong id=""><em id="">GreatDayAtlanticCity.com</em></strong></a>, launched to give youth and seniors a platform to tell the city’s story, are part of a wider push to ensure growth reaches every neighborhood. Partnerships with Visit Atlantic City, the Greater Atlantic City Chamber, and local development corporations are drawing new private investment — from Stockton University’s expanding campus to the redevelopment of Bader Field.</p><p id="">‍</p><h2 id=""><em id="">“These are the kinds of projects and partnerships that show casinos can be powerful anchors — but only when they’re part of something bigger,” Mayor Small wrote.</em></h2><p id="">‍</p><p id="">The publication in the <em id="">New York Daily News</em> marks a major moment for Atlantic City’s voice in the national conversation. It’s not just about defending the city’s gaming industry, which generates nearly $900 million annually in taxes and fees and supports more than 23,000 jobs. It’s about ensuring that any city, whether Atlantic City or New York, puts its people at the center of its growth strategy.</p><p id="">Mayor Small closed his op-ed with a reminder that resonates far beyond the Boardwalk: “Once the ribbon is cut and the headlines fade, the real work begins — and it will fall on the communities that live with these casinos long after the grand opening.”</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Read the article on the New York Daily News on this link or below:</strong></h2><p id=""><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/15/nyc-casino-lessons-from-atlantic-city/" id="">https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/15/nyc-casino-lessons-from-atlantic-city/</a></p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2000px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2000px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a33b5cf025883388254bee_NewNewspaper%20Clip.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small's Op-Ed in the New York Daily News (August 15, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p id="">‍</p><p id="">‍</p>

<description><![CDATA[Funded by federal, state, and city dollars, the two-year project will transform the roadway from Tennessee to Albany Avenues with safety, traffic, and streetscape upgrades.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">For years, the plan to rebuild Atlantic Avenue, one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares — was stalled by lawsuits, federal grant reviews, and shifting political priorities in Washington. On Thursday, city leaders said those roadblocks have finally been cleared.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small Sr., joined by Representative Jeff Van Drew and other city officials, announced that the reconstruction of Atlantic Avenue from Tennessee to Albany Avenues will go out for bid on Aug. 19, with work expected to begin in October.</p><p id="">The $17.6 million project, part of a $24.8 million, multi-phase overhaul of Atlantic Avenue, is funded by a $10.3 million Federal Highway Administration grant, along with New Jersey Department of Transportation grants and city funds. The federal grant was first approved in November 2021, but the release of funds was delayed for more than two years, most recently until this spring, when Mr. Van Drew pressed for action in Trenton and Washington.</p><p id="">“This is about more than just fresh pavement, it’s an investment in safety and quality of life for our residents,” Mr. Small said. “In government, sometimes things get in the way beyond our control. But this administration kept fighting the good fight for the taxpayers of Atlantic City.”</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1024px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1024px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/689e218a351f4657bf6e551c_Atlantic.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">‍</p><h3 id="">A Test of Persistence and Partnership</h3><p id="">Both men described the process as a test of patience and political will, involving regular phone calls, coordination across agencies, and an unusual degree of bipartisan cooperation in a polarized era.</p><p id="">“This project has been a bumpy ride and a rough road, but it’s finally going to get done,” said Mr. Van Drew, a Republican whose district includes Atlantic City. “Infrastructure shouldn’t be political. It’s about doing the right thing, getting it done, and working together for future generations.”</p><p id="">Mayor Small, a Democrat, underscored that point with a line from the late Atlantic City political figure Ernest Coursey: <em id="">“Every Democrat ain’t my friend, and every Republican is not my enemy.”</em></p><p id="">‍</p><h3 id="">A Corridor Rebuilt</h3><p id="">The funding will pay for resurfacing the roadway, upgrading traffic signals, adding ADA-compliant ramps, installing more than 200 decorative pedestrian lights, and improving signage. The upgrades aim to improve traffic flow, pedestrian safety, and accessibility, while also beautifying the corridor to support local businesses and encourage redevelopment.</p><p id="">The work is expected to take up to 24 months, with a pause during the winter. A previous phase, completed in fall 2023, repaved and restriped Atlantic Avenue from Maine to Tennessee Avenues, replaced lighting, and installed fiber-optic conduit from Tennessee to Albany.</p><h3 id="">More Than Asphalt</h3><p id="">City officials said the Atlantic Avenue improvements are part of a broader strategy to use infrastructure upgrades as a foundation for new development. Jim Rutala, the city’s planning consultant, noted that synchronized traffic signals, a long-sought goal on both Atlantic and Pacific Avenues, will make the corridor more appealing to investors.</p><p id="">“Once the development community knows the infrastructure is in place, other things start to happen,” Mr. Rutala said, pointing to planned projects including a full-service supermarket at Renaissance Plaza, the conversion of a former office building into housing, and the redevelopment of the city’s historic Armory into apartments and a public market.</p><p id="">‍</p><h3 id="">Other Projects on Deck</h3><p id="">The announcement also served as an update on several other infrastructure projects:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Pacific Avenue Signal Optimization Project</strong>: Starting next week, the city will upgrade 35 intersections with new hardware, vehicle detection systems, and seven miles of fiber-optic cable. Road resurfacing will follow conduit and junction box installation.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Baltic Avenue</strong>: Milling and paving from Maine to Missouri Avenues will begin Aug. 21, along with new curbs and sidewalks.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard</strong>: Full reconstruction from Mediterranean Avenue to Route 30 is scheduled to begin this fall.</li></ul><p id="">‍</p><p id="">For Mr. Small, each project reflects a commitment to steady, visible improvements. “This is another box checked under the Small administration,” he said. “We are bullish on infrastructure and will continue to make it a great day in the City of Atlantic City.”</p><p id="">‍</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City High School community celebrated a proud moment as recent graduate Lexi Gormley powered her way to a silver medal at the World U-19 Championships in Trakai, Lithuania, on Sunday, August 10, 2025. Representing the United States as a member of the Junior National Team, Gormley showcased both skill and determination against some of the best young rowers in the world.</p><p id="">The race began with Team USA holding steady in the middle of the pack, but in a stunning late surge, they climbed from sixth place to finish second. Great Britain claimed gold with a time of 6:47.87, followed closely by the United States at 6:49.50, and Romania earning bronze with 6:51.05.</p><p id="">“It was pretty impressive,” said Atlantic City Public Schools Athletic Director Chris Ford. “To see one of our former athletes compete on that level was great. I would not be shocked if she competed in the 2028 Summer Olympics.”</p><p id="">Superintendent of Schools Dr. La’Quetta S. Small praised Gormley’s achievement, calling it a testament to her hard work, discipline, and dedication. “She is an outstanding example for our students, showing them that with perseverance and passion, they can compete – and succeed – on the world stage. We are incredibly proud of her and look forward to seeing all she will accomplish in the future,” Dr. Small said.</p><p id="">For Ford, Gormley’s achievement brought back memories of her relentless training on the school’s rowing equipment. “I wonder if she knows how many miles she’s done on that Erg machine. It feels like a million,” he added with a smile.</p><p id="">This silver medal was not Gormley’s first taste of international success. Just last year, she brought home a bronze medal at the World U-19 Championships in St. Catharines, Canada, also as part of Team USA.</p><p id="">Her story has quickly become a source of inspiration for students across Atlantic City, proving that with commitment, talent, and community support, young athletes can achieve greatness on the global stage.</p><p id="">Gormley’s journey reflects the spirit of Atlantic City — a place where ambition is encouraged, opportunities are created, and determination is rewarded. Her success not only adds to the city’s athletic legacy but also reminds residents why Atlantic City is a community where people can live, work, and grow.</p><p id="">As the oars settled in Lithuania’s waters, the pride rippled back home, reminding everyone that the path from the shores of Atlantic City to the world stage is within reach for those who dare to dream big.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit:<strong id=""> Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In Atlantic City, summer is more than just sunshine and sea breezes — it’s a season of growth, connection, and opportunity. The Atlantic City Rowing Program has become a summer tradition, inspiring young athletes to challenge themselves, discover their strengths, and build lasting friendships both on and off the water.</p><p id="">From the first stroke of the season to the final race, the program blends discipline with joy. Early mornings on the bay become moments of focus and determination, while afternoons are filled with camaraderie and encouragement. Coaches and volunteers guide participants through a mix of technical skill-building, teamwork exercises, and personal goal-setting — lessons that carry far beyond the sport itself.</p><h6 id=""><strong id="">A City That Invests in Its Youth</strong>Atlantic City’s Rowing Program is more than a recreational activity. It’s a community effort to nurture resilience, perseverance, and leadership in the city’s next generation. By engaging youth in meaningful physical activity and providing them with positive role models, the program strengthens the fabric of the community.</h6><p id="">Parents, supporters, and local leaders see the value in these moments — the discipline that comes from training, the sportsmanship learned through competition, and the confidence built from mastering new skills. These qualities prepare young people not just for rowing, but for life.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Real Skills. Real Impact.</strong><br>While the program builds strong rowers, its real success lies in shaping well-rounded individuals. Participants learn the importance of commitment, how to push through challenges, and the reward of achieving shared goals. Friendships formed on the water become bonds that last well beyond the summer season.</p><p id="">The annual banquet, a highlight of the program, celebrates more than just trophies. It’s a gathering where families, coaches, and teammates reflect on the journey, share stories, and acknowledge the dedication shown throughout the season. It’s proof that in Atlantic City, success is measured not only by wins, but by growth.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Why Live, Work, and Grow in Atlantic City</strong><br>Programs like the Atlantic City Rowing Program show why this is a community where people can build a life. It’s a place that invests in its young people, offers unique opportunities to explore passions, and fosters a culture of encouragement and belonging.</p><p id="">Whether you’re raising a family, building a career, or simply seeking a strong sense of community, Atlantic City offers a quality of life where opportunity meets inspiration — on the water and beyond.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Atlantic City Recreation</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[Atlantic City’s first responders, alongside neighboring agencies, successfully contained a massive three-alarm fire at the unoccupied New Jersey Avenue School. No injuries were reported, and the fire was brought under control after hours of dedicated effort.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The City of Atlantic City reported that a massive three-alarm fire erupted at the New Jersey Avenue School late in the evening, prompting an immediate and coordinated response from multiple agencies. The Atlantic City Fire Department, joined by the Atlantic City Police Department, EMS, and several neighboring agencies, worked together to battle the flames well into the night. Their swift arrival at the scene and expert handling of the situation prevented the blaze from spreading to nearby buildings, safeguarding the surrounding community.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f497a1c557edf402b0a9_531118717_1075913544723114_603322577280384747_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The building, which had been unoccupied at the time of the incident, was slated for demolition, meaning there were no students, faculty, or staff inside. While the absence of occupants was a relief, the scale and intensity of the fire posed a significant challenge to the crews on site. Firefighters employed strategic measures to contain the flames, using both ground and aerial operations to bring the situation under control.</p><p id="">As the hours passed, the tireless efforts of the first responders paid off. By the early morning, the fire was declared under control, and officials confirmed that there were no injuries to either civilians or emergency personnel. This outcome was a testament to the training, dedication, and resilience of the men and women on the front lines.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f4a8dd796cf433ddbee2_529937513_1075913741389761_5537573666956042330_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The operation underscored the importance of inter-agency collaboration during emergencies. Neighboring fire departments and emergency units provided critical reinforcement, offering additional manpower, equipment, and logistical assistance that allowed the Atlantic City teams to sustain their efforts throughout the night. Every individual involved played a vital role in the successful containment of the fire, from those directing traffic to the firefighters battling flames in hazardous conditions.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f4b6224b680adc165e53_529816090_1075913761389759_2580476976676799632_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">City officials extended heartfelt gratitude to all <strong id="">brave men and women</strong> who risked their safety to protect lives and property. Their courage, skill, and commitment to service stood as a reminder of the extraordinary work done by first responders every day, often without recognition. The incident at the New Jersey Avenue School demonstrated not only the dangers they face but also the unwavering determination they bring to every call.</p><p id="">In the aftermath, authorities began their investigation into the cause of the blaze, while crews remained on-site to monitor for potential flare-ups. The community, though shaken by the dramatic event, expressed overwhelming appreciation for the coordinated and professional response that prevented what could have been a far greater tragedy.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">City of Atlantic City</strong></p>

<p id="">In Atlantic City, community isn’t just a concept — it’s something you can see, feel, and even taste. For generations, Center City Deli has been a place where neighbors gather, meals are shared, and friendships are built. Recently, the City of Atlantic City celebrated this enduring spirit by honoring the deli with the Midtown Atlantic City CDC Community Impact Award.</p><p id="">The recognition was part of the City’s “Keep It Local” campaign, led by the Economic Development division under the Planning &amp; Development Department, which shines a spotlight on small businesses that help define the heart and soul of the city.</p><p id=""><strong id="">More Than Just a Deli</strong><br>For decades, Center City Deli has been serving hearty, no-frills meals that keep locals coming back. From breakfast classics to filling lunches and dinners, the deli has built its reputation not just on its menu, but on the way it treats every customer like family.

We got something back for giving to the people, the community — it was nice.”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Why Atlantic City Thrives</strong><br>Small businesses like Center City Deli are part of what makes Atlantic City a great place to live and work. They reflect the city’s resilience, its cultural diversity, and its commitment to looking out for one another.

<p id="">In Atlantic City, summer is more than sunshine and ocean breezes, it’s also a time when the city moves forward. This year, the City of Atlantic City demonstrated its ongoing commitment to residents by adding brand-new vehicles to the Department of Public Works fleet, ensuring services remain efficient, reliable, and ready to meet community needs year-round.</p><p id="">With these new additions, the city has strengthened its ability to deliver essential public services. Whether it’s keeping streets clean, maintaining infrastructure, or responding quickly to seasonal demands, the expanded fleet helps ensure that Atlantic City runs smoothly for everyone who calls it home.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/689609c54c22c96c78d1ab56_529375203_1074411898206612_361101157321984353_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Building the Tools for Better Service</strong><br>Among the upgrades is a high-reach bucket truck for electrical work, enabling crews to handle repairs and maintenance more quickly and safely. The city also added large and small rear-load garbage trucks, boosting sanitation efforts and supporting cleaner neighborhoods from the Boardwalk to the backstreets.</p><p id="">To keep the city prepared for storm season, stormwater vactor trucks now help maintain catch basins and prevent flooding. And with a universal hook-lift truck equipped for multiple tasks — from snow plowing in winter to leaf collection in autumn — Atlantic City is better equipped for every season.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Year-Round Commitment to Quality of Life</strong><br>Each vehicle serves a specific purpose, but together they represent a bigger vision: a city that invests in the tools needed to care for its people and places. It’s about more than machinery — it’s about keeping Atlantic City a cleaner, safer, and more welcoming place for residents, businesses, and visitors.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/689609d23850ae33030716e7_528290469_1074412028206599_1901651306518018189_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Why Atlantic City Is a Great Place to Live and Work</strong><br>Investments like this reflect the spirit of Atlantic City — a community that takes pride in maintaining its neighborhoods, supporting its workforce, and creating an environment where opportunity thrives.

<description><![CDATA[Students at Richmond Avenue School soared beyond textbooks this summer as they built and programmed drones through a dynamic STEM Summer Program. From hands-on assembly to flight simulations, the initiative inspired problem-solving, teamwork, and future-ready skills in Atlantic City's next generation of innovators.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 id=""><strong id="">Atlantic City Students Take Flight with Hands-On Drone Program</strong></h2><p id="">In Atlantic City, summer learning means more than books and classrooms — it means rising to new heights. Through an innovative STEM Drone Program at Richmond Avenue School, local students spent the season not only building drones, but also building confidence, collaboration, and career dreams.</p><p id="">This program was part of the city's broader effort to provide youth with immersive, future-ready experiences. Each summer, Atlantic City’s public schools continue to push learning beyond the traditional model — and this drone program proved just how powerful that can be.</p><h3 id="">Learning by Doing</h3><p id="">Instead of passively absorbing facts, students rolled up their sleeves and assembled commercial-grade drones from the ground up. Using Rub iQ kits, they learned to wire motors, install cameras, and troubleshoot complicated circuitry. It was engineering in action — tactile, technical, and teamwork-driven.</p><p id="">“These are the most complex drones we’ve ever used,” said instructor Nabi Chowdhury, who guided the students through every challenge. “They learned to problem-solve and adapt, even when tools didn’t work as expected.”</p><p id="">From flight simulators to hands-on assembly, every step of the program pushed students to think critically and work together. For some, the learning curve was steep — and that’s exactly what made it meaningful.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688cc3cab3df9eadef01c906_RAS%20Drones.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Richmond Avenue School Drone</figcaption></figure><h3 id="">Real-World Skills, Real Impact</h3><p id="">Whether improvising with pliers to solve a mechanical issue or working through communication breakdowns as a team, students learned that success isn’t just about following instructions. It’s about curiosity, perseverance, and trust in one another.</p><p id="">Principal Shontai Harris encouraged students to connect their learning to real-world possibilities. “Drones are used in roofing, insurance, public safety — all kinds of industries,” Harris said. “What they’re doing here is engineering, and it’s valuable for so many career paths.”</p><p id="">Students also explored flight simulators to build the coordination and decision-making skills needed for real drone piloting. The experience sparked new ideas, new interests, and new connections between classmates from different backgrounds.</p><h3 id="">A Community That Lifts Its Youth</h3><p id="">When technical issues arose due to GPS signal limitations downtown, students quickly adapted — switching to older drones and planning a future launch from a nearby beach. For educators like Allison Clark, the takeaway was clear: “They were taken out of their comfort zones and rose to the challenge.”</p><p id="">The program showed that when students are trusted with real tools and real responsibility, they respond with creativity, grit, and pride.</p><h3 id="">Why Atlantic City?</h3><p id="">This STEM Drone Program is just one example of how Atlantic City continues to invest in its youth — not only in summer but year-round. From hands-on STEM camps and creative arts programs to job training and scholarships, the city is building pathways to opportunity.</p><p id="">Programs like this remind us why Atlantic City is more than a destination — it’s a community. A place where young people can see themselves reflected in their schools, their neighborhoods, and their future.</p><p id="">It’s a city where students don’t just learn — they launch.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit:&nbsp;<strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<p id="">The Atlantic City Senior Services team continued expanding its reach this week by officially welcoming the Bella Condominiums community as the 19th senior building to join the city’s monthly programming.</p><p id="">Staff visited the Bella Condominiums to meet with residents face-to-face, answer questions, and provide a warm welcome into Atlantic City’s growing network of older adult services. It was a day of connection, conversation, and celebration — marking the beginning of a new chapter for both the residents and the city.</p><p id="">As part of the city’s broader commitment to supporting older adults, this inclusion means Bella residents now have access to a wide range of Senior Services programming, including health and wellness events, educational sessions, social opportunities, and more.</p><p id="">The visit was a celebration. Staff were greeted with smiles, stories, and a shared sense of excitement about what lies ahead. Many residents expressed enthusiasm about participating in programs that help them stay informed, active, and connected.</p><p id="">Adding Bella Condominiums to the Senior Services network reflects Atlantic City’s proactive approach to outreach. Rather than waiting for seniors to come to the city, the city goes directly to them, a model that continues to strengthen trust and increase participation.</p><p id="">Under the leadership of Mayor Marty Small, Sr. and the City of Atlantic City, these initiatives aim to ensure that every senior, regardless of where they live, has access to vital resources, opportunities, and community support.</p><p id="">The Atlantic City Senior Services team continues to grow its footprint in neighborhoods across the city, working closely with building managers and residents alike to customize offerings that reflect each community’s needs.</p><p id="">As Bella Condominiums officially joins the Senior Family, the City of Atlantic City reaffirms its dedication to creating a city where residents of all ages can thrive, together.</p><p>‍</p>

<p id=""><strong id="">A Stronger Field, A Stronger Future</strong></p><p id="">In Atlantic City, parks and playfields are more than green spaces, they are gathering places, practice grounds, and community anchors. And now, thanks to a $1.33 million Green Acres Program grant, Dolphin Field has been fully revitalized, ready to serve the next generation of athletes, families, and fans.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688b8268c3c8d6d8cc0fe203_526521473_1067930162188119_1875620655671318800_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Led by Mayor Marty Small, Sr., the transformation of Dolphin Field reflects the City of Atlantic City’s ongoing investment in public recreation. From the new turf and upgraded lighting, to renovated locker rooms, improved ADA accessibility, and modern fencing and landscaping, this project was designed to enhance both performance and safety — and to give residents a facility they can be proud of.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Where Community Comes to Play</strong></h2><p id="">More than just a sports field, Dolphin Field has long been a home for local football players, especially the Atlantic City Dolphins organization.

It’s a place where kids can chase dreams and families can cheer them on.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Local Support, Lasting Impact</strong></h2><p id="">The project would not have been possible without generous community partnerships. Local developer and Hard Rock Atlantic City owner Joe Jingoli previously contributed a new scoreboard and funding for earlier improvements, which remain an important part of the field today. The city has also applied for an additional $250,000 grant from the NFL to further enhance the facility.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688b828611d7b682ca216926_524659324_1067930755521393_4997715709914658123_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">This collaborative spirit between city leaders, local donors, and residents is what makes Atlantic City more than just a destination.

<description><![CDATA[Texas Avenue School underwent major renovations, including bold new paintwork, modern locker upgrades, and a turf playground installation. The improvements marked a new era for the historic building, aligning with the district’s larger mission to modernize school facilities across Atlantic City.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Texas Avenue School in Atlantic City underwent a significant transformation, marking the beginning of a new chapter for the historic institution. As part of the Atlantic City School District’s broader investment in modernizing educational facilities, the school received extensive updates that aimed to rejuvenate both its appearance and functionality.</p><p id="">Visible from the moment one approached the building, the most striking change was the new paint job, featuring bold red accents that reflected the school’s official colors. The fresh coat of paint revitalized both the exterior and hallways, giving the building a vibrant, contemporary look while honoring its long-standing identity.</p><p id="">Beyond the surface, the school addressed deeper infrastructure needs. The third floor saw the removal of outdated lockers, some of which had been in place for decades. These were replaced with sleek, modern units, offering students more secure and accessible storage solutions. This improvement aligned with the district’s goal to create safer and more student-friendly environments.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68878fe482c48c7f7de032c7_IMG_9846.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Outdoors, the school added a new turf playground, providing a durable, safe, and visually appealing surface for students to enjoy physical activity. This upgrade was especially impactful in encouraging active play while reducing maintenance needs.</p><p id="">Principal Lina Gil expressed pride in the project, emphasizing its broader effect on the school culture. “These projects have a significant impact on staff and students by enhancing the physical environment and sense of pride in the school community,” Gil said. Her words reflected a shared sentiment among faculty and families who welcomed the updates as a sign of renewed commitment to quality education.</p><p id="">The upgrades extended to future plans as well. A brand-new kitchen was in development to improve food service operations and support more efficient meal preparation. This improvement would not only enhance daily logistics but also contribute to better nutritional experiences for students.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6887902f2144c92d8decad1c_IMG_9838.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The Texas Avenue School renovation was part of a larger district-wide initiative. Across Atlantic City, multiple schools received summer upgrades including HVAC system replacements, window installations, and classroom equipment enhancements, ensuring that students returned in the fall to facilities better suited for 21st-century learning.</p><p id="">As the first day of school approaches, Texas Avenue School stands as a powerful example of how thoughtful investment in infrastructure could support educational success. What had once been a century-old structure now felt like a beacon of renewal and readiness.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<h3 id=""><strong id="">Discipline. Leadership.

One of the most transformative examples is the <strong id="">Junior Police Academy</strong>—a two-week experience that gives local youth more than just a taste of law enforcement. It gives them the tools to lead.</p><p id="">Hosted by the <strong id="">Atlantic City Police Department</strong>, the Junior Police Academy is open to rising fifth and sixth graders, ages 11 and 12.

Some are nervous about the physical challenges. Others have never spoken in front of a group. But by the end of the program, they’re standing taller—more confident, more focused, and more connected to the idea that greatness comes through hard work.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:508px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="508px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688407607780f152d7fc20cf_Screenshot%202025-07-26%20063758.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:509px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="509px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6884077234412707ec1ee123_Screenshot%202025-07-26%20063710.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:506px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="506px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6884078067827ffe035cd76e_Screenshot%202025-07-26%20063725.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">From military drills and public speaking to locker inspections and leadership elections, every part of the academy is intentional.

<p id="">In Atlantic City, summer isn’t just a time for beaches and boardwalks, it’s also a season of opportunity. Through the <strong id="">Summer Youth Employment Program</strong>, the City of Atlantic City is giving local teens and young adults more than just a summer job. It’s offering them a launchpad into the future.</p><p id="">Spearheaded by the City of Atlantic City’s Youth Services Division, this initiative pairs local youth with hands-on job placements across the city, from government offices and community-based organizations. Participants are matched with opportunities that reflect their interests and career goals, building real-world skills in communication, leadership, and time management.</p><h3 id="">A City That Believes in Its Youth</h3><p id="">Now in its latest year, the Summer Youth Employment Program has grown into a cornerstone of the city’s youth development strategy. It’s part of Mayor Small’s broader commitment to creating pathways to success for Atlantic City’s next generation, especially those who may not otherwise have access to these types of opportunities.</p><p id="">In recent years, the program has supported hundreds of local youth with paid job experience, professional development workshops, financial literacy training, and mentorship — all while instilling a sense of civic pride and community engagement.</p><h3 id="">Real Jobs. Real Impact.</h3><p id="">What sets Atlantic City’s program apart is its emphasis on meaningful work. Participants are not observers — they are contributors. They help coordinate events, support local youth and seniors, assist in marketing campaigns, and even contribute to civic storytelling through platforms like <strong id="">GreatDayAtlanticCity.com</strong>.</p><p id="">These roles are more than resume-builders. They’re confidence-builders.</p><h3 id="">Why #LiveinAC?</h3><p id="">The Summer Youth Employment Program is just one example of why Atlantic City is more than a summer destination, it’s a community where young people can see a future for themselves.</p><p id="">From the Mayor’s $3M scholarship initiative and the Small Business Academy, to free summer events, beach concerts, and family programming across all neighborhoods, Atlantic City is evolving into a place where opportunity lives year-round.</p><h3 id="">A City in Motion</h3><p id="">Beyond the youth program, Atlantic City is investing in walkable neighborhoods, public art, affordable housing, and small business support. These efforts are reshaping the city’s reputation by showing the world what locals already know: Atlantic City is a place to live, work, and thrive.</p><p id="">This summer, as tourists soak in the sun, local teens will be busy making connections, gaining skills, and discovering their own power to shape the city they call home.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:400px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="400px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688405a271118bb96b522180_LEA-9460.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id=""><strong id="">The City of Atlantic City is proud of its role in driving programs that break barriers and build bridges.

<description><![CDATA[The Brighton Botanical Garden bloomed into more than just a school project this summer. Through shared care, learning, and the joy of harvest, it became a symbol of growth, teamwork, and community pride.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">While many students at Brighton Avenue School welcomed their break, a different kind of learning continued to grow in the school’s front yard — within the vibrant space known as the Brighton Botanical Garden.</p><p id="">Rather than letting the flourishing garden go untended, the school’s Summer Program turned it into a daily hands-on learning hub. Staff and students arrived each morning to the scent of fresh herbs, the sight of leafy vegetables, and the chance to contribute to something meaningful.</p><p id="">The experience quickly became more than just gardening. It nurtured teamwork and ownership. “We all pitched in and helped,” said Principal Jason Grimes. “The parents from our school leadership team donated the dirt.” This generosity laid the foundation — quite literally — for a summer of discovery.</p><p id="">Students learned how to water, weed, and manage pests. For many, it was their first real introduction to sustainable gardening, teaching them patience, respect for nature, and the satisfaction of watching their work come to life. Even staff members unfamiliar with gardening found themselves learning side by side with the kids.</p><p id="">A major milestone came with the garden’s first harvest — thick, crisp cucumbers that matched the quality of any store-bought variety. “We taught the kids how to make a cucumber salad,” Grimes said, celebrating the garden’s transition from science lab to kitchen table.</p><p id="">The garden became a bridge between home and school. Parents who had helped early on with soil and supplies returned throughout the summer to weed, water, and check in on the garden’s progress. Their continued involvement turned the project into a true community collaboration.</p><p id="">Looking ahead, the Summer Program prepared the space for the upcoming school year. Staff and students began to plant cover crops, apply mulch, and ready the soil for fall’s next big goal: harvesting pumpkins before the winter chill sets in.</p><p id="">What began as a seasonal activity had evolved into a symbol of what’s possible when students, educators, and families work together. The Brighton Botanical Garden became a shared success — a living, growing testament to resilience, creativity, and community spirit.</p><p id="">“This is truly a community effort,” Principal Grimes reflected — a statement that echoed through every vine, root, and bite of cucumber.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id=""> Photo Credit: <strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[The City of Atlantic City has begun construction on an $8.5 million Bulkhead Replacement Project in the Chelsea neighborhood, continuing its mission to improve storm resiliency. The project, funded through a grant from the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, is a key component of a broader strategy to protect vulnerable communities from future flooding.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">As part of its long-term vision to combat the growing threats of climate change and coastal flooding, the City of Atlantic City officially began construction on an $8.5 million Bulkhead Replacement Project in the Chelsea neighborhood on July 23, 2025. The project is one of many ongoing efforts aimed at making the city more resilient against storms and tidal surges.</p><p id="">The construction, managed by Richard E. Pierson Company, included replacing public bulkheads along the back bay from Albany Avenue to Morris Avenue. In addition to the structural upgrades, improvements were made to stormwater outfalls, sidewalks were restored, and new trees were planted, adding both function and aesthetic value to the neighborhood.</p><p id="">The project is funded by a grant from the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) and reflects the city’s strategic investment in community protection. Mayor Marty Small, Sr. emphasized that this initiative is aligned with his administration’s promise to prioritize resiliency, while also being mindful of taxpayer interests.</p><p id="">“The Small Administration has made a commitment to sure up our resiliency here in the Great City of Atlantic City with the best interest of our taxpayers in mind,” stated Mayor Small. “Through various projects like this, we are not only protecting our residents and businesses, but we are also investing in the future of our community.”</p><p id="">Beyond Chelsea, the city has launched or planned several other major infrastructure upgrades. A $16 million upgrade of the Atlantis Avenue Pump Station is expected to be completed by the end of the year. This station will help manage stormwater across Midtown and Inlet neighborhoods, reducing the risk of localized flooding.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68814953084a8a02515990fe_unnamed%20(11).jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6881496030c347613837b706_unnamed%20(12).jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">In addition, the Ducktown Bulkhead Replacement Project and Fisherman’s Park Pump Station upgrades are scheduled to begin before the year ends. Both initiatives are partially funded by the U.S. Economic Development Agency, and represent a continuation of the city’s partnership with federal and state entities to secure funding for critical projects.</p><p id="">Jim Rutala, the city’s grant consultant from Rutala Associates, noted that the foundation for this comprehensive resiliency strategy was developed as early as 2012. He emphasized that the real momentum came after Mayor Small took office, resulting in a wave of successful grant applications and carefully executed infrastructure projects.</p><p id="">According to City Engineering Director Uzo Ahiarakwe, the Chelsea Bulkhead Replacement is just one piece of a broader puzzle. “Under this current administration there has been a strong emphasis on resiliency and addressing quality of life concerns. Chelsea bulkhead Replacement is one part of a comprehensive package in which we’re trying to address each and every component of resiliency.”</p><p id="">Already, previous phases of bulkhead improvements have been completed in Lower Chelsea, Chelsea Heights, and Gardner’s Basin. Additionally, most of the check valves regulating stormwater discharge have been upgraded. The city also celebrated the nearing completion of the $60 million Inlet Seawall and boardwalk project, providing a vital line of defense for the Inlet neighborhood and linking Ocean Casino Resort to Gardner’s Basin Park.</p><p id="">Looking forward, the city is preparing the next generation of resiliency projects. FEMA-funded studies are underway in Bungalow Park, Venice Park, Chelsea/Ducktown, and Chelsea Heights, which will inform future infrastructure and environmental improvements as funding becomes available. These studies demonstrate Atlantic City’s commitment to long-term preparedness in the face of environmental challenges.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City Senior Services team took a bold and refreshing step with their programming by going beyond city limits—and even state lines. In a unique and spirited outing, the group boarded the Great Day Bus and embarked on an exciting journey that blended relaxation, shopping, and stunning scenery.</p><p id="">Their destination? Rehoboth Beach, Delaware—a bustling coastal town known for its beaches, outlets, and friendly charm. But before hitting the shopping haven, the seniors enjoyed an unforgettable experience aboard the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, gliding smoothly across the shimmering water with smiles on their faces and excitement in the air.</p><p id="">The ferry ride itself was a highlight. With clear skies, calm waters, and a gentle breeze, the crossing felt more like a mini-cruise than a commute. Spirits were high, and many took in the scenic views while chatting and sharing laughs on deck.</p><p id="">Once in Delaware, the group headed straight to the outlet malls of Rehoboth Beach, where deals awaited and bags quickly filled. The seniors explored shops at their own pace, enjoying both the thrill of bargain hunting and the fun of bonding with fellow participants.</p><p id="">The outing was a chance for many to break routine, make new memories, and experience a change of scenery. For some, it was their first time traveling outside New Jersey in years, and the sense of adventure brought a spark of joy that lit up every face.</p><p id="">Staff members made sure everyone felt supported and safe throughout the day, providing assistance, encouragement, and plenty of laughter along the way. It wasn’t just a shopping trip—it was a celebration of life, community, and connection.</p><p id="">The weather couldn’t have been more perfect. With blue skies and gorgeous temperatures, it felt like the universe itself was cheering on the day’s success.</p><p id="">By late afternoon, the group made their way back, tired but happy, their hearts and shopping bags full. The return ferry ride served as a peaceful wind-down, with stories and photos shared, and a quiet sense of contentment settling in.</p><p id="">This adventure proved once again that Atlantic City Senior Services is committed to creating experiences that go beyond expectations—and sometimes, beyond borders.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Atlantic City Senior Services</strong></p>

<p id="">The City of Atlantic City turned its spotlight on the future by hosting a powerful and emotional celebration at the historic Steel Pier. The occasion honored 113 recipients of the Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship, recognizing the academic achievements, dreams, and determination of local students who represent the city’s next generation of leaders.</p><p id="">The event was a true community moment, filled with pride, hope, and gratitude. Students stood proudly alongside their families as they accepted their ceremonial checks, posed for photos with Mayor Marty Small, Sr., and shared in the excitement of a milestone that brings them one step closer to achieving their academic and career goals.</p><p id="">Each scholarship, valued at up to $10,000, was awarded to eligible Atlantic City residents. The recipients included a diverse mix of students—incoming college freshmen, current undergraduates, and those pursuing Masters, Doctorate, or Trade School education. This year’s group represented a wide range of aspirations: future nurses, engineers, educators, entrepreneurs, and more.</p><p id="">Funds were split into two disbursements—half for Fall 2025, and half for Spring 2026—to ensure continued support throughout the school year. While the checks handed out during the event were symbolic, the real funds were sent directly to the recipients’ academic institutions, reinforcing accountability and purpose.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:640px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="640px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/686550c680a6ba890c5f3fb1_scholarship-winners-2025.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The choice of Steel Pier as the venue was symbolic.

Against the backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean, the event reflected Atlantic City’s enduring spirit and its bright future.</p><p id="">In his address, Mayor Marty Small, Sr. spoke from the heart. He shared how deeply committed his administration is to uplifting youth, removing barriers to education, and building pathways to success. Since the scholarship program launched in 2023, it has awarded hundreds of Atlantic City residents with direct financial support—made possible through the city's allocation of American Rescue Plan funds under the "Addressing Educational Disparity" category.</p><p id="">This year’s awards expanded eligibility beyond just Atlantic City High School students, opening doors for all residents regardless of what high school they attend or attended. That inclusiveness contributed to a record number of applications in 2025, demonstrating a growing awareness and demand for educational opportunity in the city.</p><p id="">The presence of parents, educators, mentors, and city leaders made the event even more meaningful. They served as living proof of the power of a community that comes together to invest in its youth. Their cheers, applause, and tearful moments reminded everyone of what this celebration truly stood for—opportunity, equity, and hope.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1183px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1183px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687faf63e40c652b621444b4_Screenshot%202025-07-22%20215239.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">#LiveinAC: A City That Believes in Its Students</h3><p id="">Beyond the celebration itself, the event was a powerful call to action. It reminded residents, alumni, and stakeholders that supporting education is a shared responsibility. Whether through mentoring, sponsorship, or simply sharing resources, everyone has a role to play in shaping the future of Atlantic City’s young people.</p><p id="">By honoring these scholars, the city not only celebrated achievement but also sent a strong message: Atlantic City believes in its students. That belief is now being carried by 113 individuals who will go on to pursue their education with confidence and pride.</p><h3 id="">#InvestinAC: Scholarships That Change Lives</h3><p id="">The 2025 Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship Celebration was more than just an event—it was a statement of purpose.

<p id="">Week 3 of Great Day Summer Camp, hosted by the City of Atlantic City Multicultural Services, offered a full lineup of exploration, creativity, and hands-on fun for campers of all ages. Each day introduced a new theme and set of activities designed to inspire, educate, and engage — and the results were nothing short of amazing.</p><p id="">Monday kicked off with Nature Day, where campers painted planter pots and planted their own succulents to take home. With dirt on their hands and smiles on their faces, they learned the importance of caring for living things and the joy of nurturing their own plants.</p><p id="">On Tuesday, the camp moved into a more artistic space with a visit to the Noyes Arts Garage. The spotlight was on Vincent van Gogh, as campers experimented with the impasto technique and created textured paintings inspired by the master himself. The creativity was flowing, and the results were colorful and deeply personal works of art.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1137px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1137px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687a8438598ba970c29f40bc_Screenshot%202025-07-19%20012750.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Wednesday brought an extra dose of adventure. Our K–2 campers stepped into fantasy at Storybook Land, where fairy tales came alive through rides and attractions. Meanwhile, our 3rd–6th graders experienced the awe of the Atlantic City Airshow, watching jets soar across the sky in an unforgettable aerial performance.</p><p id="">The week wrapped up with a trip to the Cape May Zoo on Thursday. Surrounded by animals and lush greenery, campers enjoyed an up-close look at wildlife while learning about conservation and animal habitats. From lions to lemurs, every encounter was met with excitement and curiosity.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1262px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1262px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687a844e3c6efe403a318f34_Screenshot%202025-07-19%20012738.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Every day of camp was more than just fun — it was a chance for campers to express themselves, connect with others, and explore the world around them. The thoughtful programming ensured that each child walked away with both memories and meaningful experiences.</p><p id="">The week’s theme may have been about nature, art, and adventure, but the heart of it was connection — to creativity, to community, and to each other.</p><p id="">It truly was a Great Day week. We’re so proud of what our campers accomplished and experienced, and we can’t wait to share what’s in store for Week 4.</p><p id="">Stay tuned — the adventure continues!</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Atlantic City Multicultural Services</strong></p>

<p id="">While crowds gathered to witness the awe-inspiring performances at the Atlantic City Air Show and joined in the energy of the Soar &amp; Shore Festival, another group was hard at work — out of the spotlight but at the center of every secure moment. These were Atlantic City’s First Responders.</p><p id="">From the early planning stages to the final jet flyover, the Atlantic City Police Department, Atlantic City Professional Firefighters NJ FMBA Local 8, Atlantic City Beach Patrol, and the Atlantic City Office of Emergency Management, along with their partners from the New Jersey State Police, Atlantic County Office of Emergency Management, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City, and AtlantiCare, played critical roles in safeguarding the community.</p><p id="">Their commitment to public safety was visible in every direction — from patrolling the boardwalk to managing emergency response points and keeping swimmers safe. They ensured that the festive atmosphere remained just that: joyful, not chaotic.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1386px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1386px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687a7ae5be27150ad4a9b2e1_Screenshot%202025-07-19%20004815.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">First Responders during the Atlantic City Air Show and Practice Day</figcaption></figure><p id="">This level of coordination and calm professionalism doesn’t happen by accident. It reflects countless hours of training, preparation, and a shared goal: to serve and protect. These teams worked together seamlessly to manage crowds, monitor weather changes, respond to incidents, and provide medical assistance when needed.</p><p id="">The calm presence of these men and women reassured both residents and visitors alike. Their visibility and vigilance meant that families could focus on enjoying the shows and the shoreline, knowing that their safety was in good hands.</p><p id="">Whether in uniform on the beach, in emergency vehicles throughout the city, or operating behind the scenes at command centers, these responders never paused — even as the celebration continued.</p><p id="">Thanks to their work, the week’s events concluded without major incident, making it one of the most successful and secure air show festivals to date.</p><p id="">We recognize and appreciate every individual who contributed their time, skills, and presence to make this possible.</p><p id="">To every first responder involved, the City of Atlantic City thanks you.

<description><![CDATA[Uptown School Complex underwent major upgrades this summer, including HVAC improvements, a new roof, and interior renovations. While work progressed, the school community embraced collaboration and creativity through shared summer programs with Pennsylvania Avenue School.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Uptown School Complex in Atlantic City underwent major capital improvements this summer as part of a district-wide initiative to enhance infrastructure and learning environments. These upgrades marked a transformative phase in the school’s development and demonstrated a deep commitment to student success, safety, and innovation.</p><p id="">Completed projects included the installation of a new roof, significant upgrades to the HVAC and boiler systems, and the replacement of interior doors. Each improvement was aimed at increasing energy efficiency, building sustainability, and maintaining a safe learning space for students and staff alike.</p><p id="">“These capital improvements at Uptown School Complex reflected our district’s ongoing commitment to providing safe spaces where students could learn and thrive,” said Superintendent of Schools Dr. La’Quetta S. Small.</p><p id="">While construction was underway, Uptown’s summer school program was temporarily relocated to Pennsylvania Avenue School. This transition created opportunities for stronger inter-school cooperation and led to a shared sense of purpose among educators and families. “I was incredibly proud of the collaboration between our school leaders, teachers, and families to ensure uninterrupted summer learning,” said Dr. Small.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1076px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1076px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6877bac41d2f28da259bd22e_Screenshot%202025-07-16%20224356.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The relocation allowed both schools to jointly launch new initiatives, including a Visual and Performing Arts program. The highlight was a joint production of <em id="">101 Dalmatians Kids</em>, which featured a combined cast and creative team. “It helped build camaraderie rather than competition,” said Uptown School Complex Principal Dr. Ananda Davis-Wright.</p><p id="">STEM education also flourished during the summer session. Principal Thomas Biggins of Pennsylvania Avenue School noted that students embraced STEM “not as an assignment, but as a passion.”</p><p id="">Both schools also operated Extended School Year (ESY) programs, which served students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). These programs provided consistency and helped minimize summer learning loss. “It helped keep some of our exceptional students in their routines,” Biggins said.</p><p id="">Throughout the summer, Dr. Davis-Wright managed responsibilities across both sites, beginning her mornings at Uptown to supervise transportation and continuing her day from a temporary office inside Pennsylvania Avenue School’s media center.</p><p id="">The upgrades at Uptown were part of Atlantic City Public Schools’ broader efforts to modernize facilities during the summer break. “These improvements were appreciated by all,” said Davis-Wright. “The **teachers will love it. The students will love it. And it addressed parents’ concerns.”</p><p id="">As the final construction work wrapped up, the spirit of teamwork and adaptability showcased how Atlantic City Public Schools continues to prioritize safety, community, and educational excellence. “It was a massive job,” Davis-Wright said. “You don’t realize how big it is until you watch it taking place.”</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[Summer brought a wave of transformation to Atlantic City Public Schools, with the long-awaited demolition of New Jersey Avenue School paving the way for a brand-new administration building. The initiative reflected the district’s continued commitment to modernization, community needs, and long-term infrastructure improvement.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">While students and teachers enjoyed a well-earned break after the school year ended in June, Atlantic City Public Schools launched into a season of progress and preparation. The summer of 2025 was marked by critical upgrades, facility improvements, and one of the district’s most historic transitions—the demolition of the New Jersey Avenue School.</p><p id="">Located in the heart of the city, the New Jersey Avenue School had been closed since 2012, when the Pennsylvania Avenue School opened its doors. Later that same year, the building sustained severe damage during Hurricane Sandy, leaving it structurally compromised and unusable. For over a decade, the structure remained a silent witness to the city’s evolution—until this summer.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687514ac1ceaf52d0fdbe7ca_515439349_1274583634671386_7688235278503441965_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""> The district began preparing the site for a fresh start. Built in 1925, the school was set to be cleared to make room for a state-of-the-art administration building that will serve the entire district.</p><p id="">"We have committed to building an administration building," said Board of Education President Shay Steele. “This board, in conjunction with the leadership of Dr. Small, has made this project a priority. We are excited to fulfill the wishes of the community and also provide the district with a building of its own. This has been part of our mission, and upon completion we will have a state-of-the-art facility.”</p><p id="">According to Dr. Small, who began her teaching career at the New Jersey Avenue School in 2003, the new structure would centralize district operations and provide improved access for families, staff, and the community. She emphasized that the project represented more than just new construction—it embodied the district’s values of equity, excellence, and long-term investment.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687514b795eb97899ada80b5_516827840_1274583638004719_3528606820960726490_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">“This is part of our ongoing commitment to modernize facilities and strengthen our infrastructure,” Dr. Small stated. “We want to ensure that both our students and our staff have the resources and support they need to succeed.”</p><p id="">Beyond the demolition, multiple summer projects were underway across the district. From classroom upgrades to campus repairs and efficiency improvements, the quiet summer months provided the perfect opportunity to enhance the learning environment before students returned in September.</p><p id="">The momentum reflected the district’s proactive approach to maintaining safe, functional, and inspiring schools. By taking advantage of the summer downtime, the district ensured that learning spaces were not just ready—but better than ever.</p><p id="">As the weeks progressed, Atlantic City Public Schools continued to update the community on ongoing projects and initiatives. The demolition of the New Jersey Avenue School served as both a symbolic and practical milestone—a reminder that even when classrooms are empty, the work of building a brighter future for Atlantic City never stopped.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

The music added a regal ambiance as the graduates made their entrance.</p><p id="">One of the ceremony’s most touching highlights came from student speaker Sumiya Shahid, who delivered a heartfelt address filled with gratitude and wisdom. Reflecting on the ups and downs of middle school, she shared, “We’ve made it through the rollercoaster that is middle school,” citing everything from science fairs to group projects.

With a summer full of social events ahead, seniors were eager to learn how to bring their ideas to life through digital design.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/686557ee9f65dca0c3c8accd_514334311_598129329996702_1368823852246631976_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">Guided by a patient and enthusiastic instructor, participants were introduced to the basics of layout, color choices, text tools, and image uploading.

Their enthusiasm transformed the room into a space of lively discussion, helpful peer support, and moments of personal achievement.</p><p id="">The session not only taught design skills but also fostered confidence in using digital tools. Several participants expressed excitement about sharing their new knowledge with friends and even using Canva to promote upcoming family events or neighborhood get-togethers.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:891px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="891px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/686557dd147987386f13c5b5_Screenshot%202025-07-03%20000101.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">Beyond the screen, the event served as a reminder of the power of lifelong learning.

<description><![CDATA[The CRDA launched a $2 million Microloan Program to support small-scale development projects in Atlantic City, offering up to $500,000 per loan to empower local entrepreneurs. This initiative reflected CRDA’s commitment to inclusive economic growth and accessible financing.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) officially launched a $2 million Microloan Program on June 30, 2025, marking a significant milestone in Atlantic City’s economic development efforts. This initiative was designed to support small-scale projects that often struggle to obtain conventional financing, opening new doors for local businesses and developers.</p><p id="">With loans of up to $500,000 per application, the program aimed to cover up to 50% of eligible project costs, such as construction, equipment purchases, and permits. The program offered flexible five-to-ten-year terms and competitive interest rates, helping ensure sustainability and accessibility for small business owners.</p><p id="">The microloan initiative aligned with CRDA’s broader mission of economic revitalization, particularly in areas that needed targeted support. According to CRDA Executive Director Eric Scheffler, the program showcased the Authority’s “continued commitment to fostering economic growth in Atlantic City.” He emphasized that creating easier funding pathways was essential for enabling local businesses to thrive.</p><p id="">Lance Landgraf, CRDA’s Director of Planning and Development, highlighted that the loan process was structured to serve those most in need. Applicants were required to demonstrate efforts to secure traditional financing, invest at least 20% equity, and provide personal guarantees. This ensured that the funding went to viable, well-considered ventures poised to benefit the community.</p><p id="">The microloan program was set to begin accepting applications on July 1, 2025, and was scheduled to run through December 31, 2025, or until funds were fully allocated. Importantly, all construction financed through the program was mandated to comply with prevailing wage requirements, reinforcing the CRDA’s commitment to ethical development standards.</p><p id="">CRDA also committed to evaluating the program’s performance after six months. Depending on outcomes, the Authority would consider extending or expanding the initiative to further fuel Atlantic City’s development momentum.</p><p id="">This program was part of a broader shift in CRDA’s strategy. Once focused on statewide projects, CRDA has since evolved into a key economic engine for Atlantic City, responsible not only for financing but also for land use regulation, tourism marketing, and community development. The Authority’s ongoing efforts have already spurred nearly $2 billion in investments across over 400 projects, with $1.8 billion invested directly in Atlantic City.</p><p id="">The launch of the Microloan Program reaffirmed CRDA’s dedication to empowering local businesses and fostering a more resilient, inclusive economy. By focusing on access, equity, and smart investment, the Authority continued to play a vital role in shaping the future of Atlantic City.</p><h5 id="">For more details and application procedures, interested parties were encouraged to visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.njcrda.com" id="">www.njcrda.com</a> or contact CRDA’s Planning and Development Division at (609) 347-0500.</h5><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Casino Reinvestment Development Authority</strong></p>

<p id="">The City of Atlantic City marked a significant milestone with the opening of its first official Dog Park, giving local residents and their furry companions a dedicated space to enjoy the outdoors. The Grand Opening event took place on June 26, 2025, at S. New Hampshire and Pacific Avenues in Altman Park, and featured a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Mayor Marty Small, Sr., city officials, and representatives from the Inlet Community Development Corporation (CDC).</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685e9db3297e5a594e7a7772_512734424_1041325798181889_5219920099845788511_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">This new dog-friendly facility was created to promote exercise, socialization, and a sense of community among dog owners. Designed with both safety and enjoyment in mind, the park consisted of two separate play areas: one for dogs over 40 pounds, and another for those up to 40 pounds.</p><p id="">Each section included obstacle course equipment, open spaces for running, and plenty of room for dogs to interact. The surfaces featured a combination of grass and mulch to support comfort and safety while dogs played.</p><p id="">To help maintain cleanliness, the Dog Park was equipped with multiple waste stations, including bags provided on site. Pet owners were expected to dispose of waste properly to keep the space clean and enjoyable for everyone.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685e9dc40d2a52392415fcf6_513118290_1041231128191356_4735228949808123430_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Health and safety were also top priorities. All dogs using the park were required to have up-to-date vaccinations. Owners with aggressive dogs were asked not to bring them, ensuring a peaceful environment for all visitors.</p><p id="">The Dog Park operated from sunrise to sunset, with gates locked outside of these hours. This schedule was set to help manage activity in the park and promote responsible usage.</p><p id="">The project was a collaboration between several city departments. The Health &amp; Human Services Department oversaw park operations, while the Planning &amp; Development Department handled the design. Funding was secured through the City of Atlantic City's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Office.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685e9dd166e92d3cefc79ef8_511997320_1041231118191357_9212393542981819025_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The new park reflected the city's commitment to enhancing recreational opportunities and quality of life for residents.

<p id="">The City of Atlantic City's Multicultural Services wrapped up a meaningful week of outreach, celebration, and community-building with a series of events aimed at fostering inclusion and cultural awareness across the city.</p><p id="">The week began with Consulate Day, where representatives from the Consulate General of the People's Republic of Bangladesh visited Atlantic City to offer direct assistance to local residents. The initiative made essential services more accessible for Bangladeshi community members, eliminating the need to travel to larger cities for support. It was a welcomed opportunity for many to connect with consular staff and receive guidance on important documentation and services.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1440px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1440px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685c07071b667c055b08f3b2_513524269_738182312221151_1777441432368886165_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Midweek, the department took part in the city’s annual Juneteenth Celebration, a vibrant event recognizing the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in the United States. Staff from Multicultural Services hosted an interactive table filled with engaging take-home items such as coloring pages, magnet kits, and temporary tattoos, allowing families to engage with the holiday’s themes of freedom, resilience, and heritage in a fun and educational way.</p><p id="">To cap off the week, Multicultural Services organized a community trip to Philadelphia, where participants explored two of the city’s most iconic cultural hubs: Reading Terminal Market and Chinatown. From tasting diverse cuisines to experiencing the sights and sounds of a different urban environment, the trip offered both enjoyment and a chance to connect with one another beyond city borders.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1440px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1440px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685c07114da75c234b7a0af9_511001917_738182325554483_3547819416052801395_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">“Each of these events served as a reminder of our city's rich diversity and the importance of fostering spaces where everyone feels seen, supported, and celebrated,” said a representative from the department.</p><p id="">The week’s programming underscored the department’s ongoing mission to bridge communities, elevate voices, and promote shared experiences across cultural lines.

<description><![CDATA[The Atlantic City Police Athletic League, Police Department, and community leaders came together to unveil a new wrestling mat and launch the city's first coed youth wrestling team—the Atlantic City Lions—providing local youth with a powerful outlet for discipline, strength, and self-worth.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City took a major step forward in youth development and community engagement with the launch of the Atlantic City Lions, the city's first-ever youth wrestling team. In a joint effort between the Atlantic City Police Athletic League (PAL), the Atlantic City Police Department, and the Atlantic City Police Foundation, the initiative was made official with the donation of a brand-new 40-by-42-foot wrestling mat featuring bold logos for PAL, ACPD, and the newly formed team.</p><p id="">The mat, installed at the PAL building on New York Avenue, symbolized much more than a place to train—it represented opportunity, mentorship, and the beginning of a new athletic chapter for the city’s youth. Coach Marcus Holmes, an Atlantic City firefighter and former wrestler, leads the program with a mission to unite local kids, give them an outlet beyond the streets, and teach them valuable life skills such as resilience, patience, and self-discipline.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1201px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1201px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685ae7c73a33689b8e17c077_Screenshot%202025-06-25%20020022.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The team is coed and expected to draw over 50 youth athletes from across the city. Young wrestlers like Edward Balderas Cruz and Giovanny Jimenez shared how the sport has already impacted them, improving their strength, speed, confidence, and commitment.</p><p id="">For Lt. Will Santiago, PAL’s executive director and Atlantic City native, the project is deeply personal. Recognizing that many local youth gravitate only toward football or basketball, Santiago said introducing wrestling offers an important alternative path that can keep kids engaged, healthy, and off the streets.</p><p id="">Police Chief James Sarkos, who wrestled in high school, was instrumental in making the vision a reality. Citing his own experience with the sport’s positive influence on self-esteem and focus, he emphasized the importance of finding the right coach and the right setting to build long-term enthusiasm. Sarkos also noted the sport’s potential to open doors to college scholarships and future opportunities.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1388px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1388px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685ae8494614e2207bb19d74_Screenshot%202025-06-25%20020205.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz applauded the effort, calling the turnout and investment “tremendous” and highlighting PAL’s ongoing commitment to enriching the lives of young people. The PAL building continues to offer a variety of activities, including track, boxing, flag football, basketball, and a computer room for schoolwork—further proving that this isn’t just about sports, but about building a supportive environment where children can thrive.</p><p id="">With strong community support, a passionate coaching staff, and a clear mission, the Atlantic City Lions have already begun shaping the city’s next generation—on the mat and beyond.</p>
