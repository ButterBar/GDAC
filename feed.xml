<description><![CDATA[Atlantic City’s first responders, alongside neighboring agencies, successfully contained a massive three-alarm fire at the unoccupied New Jersey Avenue School. No injuries were reported, and the fire was brought under control after hours of dedicated effort.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The City of Atlantic City reported that a massive three-alarm fire erupted at the New Jersey Avenue School late in the evening, prompting an immediate and coordinated response from multiple agencies. The Atlantic City Fire Department, joined by the Atlantic City Police Department, EMS, and several neighboring agencies, worked together to battle the flames well into the night. Their swift arrival at the scene and expert handling of the situation prevented the blaze from spreading to nearby buildings, safeguarding the surrounding community.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f497a1c557edf402b0a9_531118717_1075913544723114_603322577280384747_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The building, which had been unoccupied at the time of the incident, was slated for demolition, meaning there were no students, faculty, or staff inside. While the absence of occupants was a relief, the scale and intensity of the fire posed a significant challenge to the crews on site. Firefighters employed strategic measures to contain the flames, using both ground and aerial operations to bring the situation under control.</p><p id="">As the hours passed, the tireless efforts of the first responders paid off. By the early morning, the fire was declared under control, and officials confirmed that there were no injuries to either civilians or emergency personnel. This outcome was a testament to the training, dedication, and resilience of the men and women on the front lines.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f4a8dd796cf433ddbee2_529937513_1075913741389761_5537573666956042330_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The operation underscored the importance of inter-agency collaboration during emergencies. Neighboring fire departments and emergency units provided critical reinforcement, offering additional manpower, equipment, and logistical assistance that allowed the Atlantic City teams to sustain their efforts throughout the night. Every individual involved played a vital role in the successful containment of the fire, from those directing traffic to the firefighters battling flames in hazardous conditions.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6899f4b6224b680adc165e53_529816090_1075913761389759_2580476976676799632_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">City officials extended heartfelt gratitude to all <strong id="">brave men and women</strong> who risked their safety to protect lives and property. Their courage, skill, and commitment to service stood as a reminder of the extraordinary work done by first responders every day, often without recognition. The incident at the New Jersey Avenue School demonstrated not only the dangers they face but also the unwavering determination they bring to every call.</p><p id="">In the aftermath, authorities began their investigation into the cause of the blaze, while crews remained on-site to monitor for potential flare-ups. The community, though shaken by the dramatic event, expressed overwhelming appreciation for the coordinated and professional response that prevented what could have been a far greater tragedy.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">City of Atlantic City</strong></p>

<p id="">In Atlantic City, community isn’t just a concept — it’s something you can see, feel, and even taste.

Recently, the City of Atlantic City celebrated this enduring spirit by honoring the deli with the Midtown Atlantic City CDC Community Impact Award.</p><p id="">The recognition was part of the City’s “Keep It Local” campaign, led by the Economic Development division under the Planning &amp; Development Department, which shines a spotlight on small businesses that help define the heart and soul of the city.</p><p id=""><strong id="">More Than Just a Deli</strong><br>For decades, Center City Deli has been serving hearty, no-frills meals that keep locals coming back. From breakfast classics to filling lunches and dinners, the deli has built its reputation not just on its menu, but on the way it treats every customer like family. Owner Theo Dababneh and his team know their customers by name — often their children and grandchildren, too — creating a welcoming space where food and friendship go hand in hand.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:576px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="576px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68960ee5f1767fcb7e473b16_Screenshot%202025-08-08%20224457.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">A Local Institution</strong><br>The award recognized Center City Deli not only for its longevity, but also for its role in bringing neighbors together.

<p id="">In Atlantic City, summer is more than sunshine and ocean breezes, it’s also a time when the city moves forward. This year, the City of Atlantic City demonstrated its ongoing commitment to residents by adding brand-new vehicles to the Department of Public Works fleet, ensuring services remain efficient, reliable, and ready to meet community needs year-round.</p><p id="">With these new additions, the city has strengthened its ability to deliver essential public services.

The city also added large and small rear-load garbage trucks, boosting sanitation efforts and supporting cleaner neighborhoods from the Boardwalk to the backstreets.</p><p id="">To keep the city prepared for storm season, stormwater vactor trucks now help maintain catch basins and prevent flooding. And with a universal hook-lift truck equipped for multiple tasks — from snow plowing in winter to leaf collection in autumn — Atlantic City is better equipped for every season.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Year-Round Commitment to Quality of Life</strong><br>Each vehicle serves a specific purpose, but together they represent a bigger vision: a city that invests in the tools needed to care for its people and places.

<p id="">In Atlantic City, summer isn't only a time for fun in the sun—it's also a season of creativity, learning, and community expression. Through the city's investment in youth engagement and the arts, public spaces have become platforms for empowerment and education. One standout example is the <strong id="">STEAM Dreams</strong> mural at <strong id="">Levine Staller</strong>, a vibrant collaboration between the <strong id="">Atlantic City Arts Foundation</strong>, acclaimed muralist <strong id="">Layqa Nuna Yawar</strong>, and the youth of the <strong id="">Boys &amp; Girls Club of Atlantic City</strong>.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Inspiring the Next Generation Through STEAM</strong><br>This mural was more than a public art installation—it was a message to young people across Atlantic City: <strong id="">your ideas matter</strong>. Completed as part of Apple’s 2020 initiative to expand coding education in over a dozen cities, <strong id="">STEAM Dreams</strong> celebrated the launch of Atlantic City’s <strong id="">Design Lab</strong> and two <strong id="">STEAM Labs</strong> at local Boys &amp; Girls Club locations. These labs gave youth access to hands-on programs in <strong id="">creativity</strong>, <strong id="">technology</strong>, and <strong id="">career development</strong>, showing them how science and art can intersect to open doors for the future.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1080px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1080px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/689218609afed457b3745226_528046384_1313682067428818_4024900644047140418_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">A New Era of Learning</strong><br>By combining <strong id="">Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics</strong>, the mural reflected the evolving approach to education that gives students the tools to succeed beyond the classroom. Known as <strong id="">STEAM</strong>, this model encourages problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and the kind of imagination that powers innovation.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Public Art with Purpose</strong><br>What made this project truly special was the <strong id="">collaborative process</strong>. The mural was co-designed with local youth, ensuring that their voices were part of the creative journey. For many of these students, it was their first opportunity to see their ideas realized on a large scale, turning a downtown wall into a beacon of possibility for the entire community.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Place to Live, to Work, to Create</strong><br>Atlantic City continues to grow as a place where young people don’t just participate—they lead. Whether through art, employment programs, or education initiatives, the city is investing in the full potential of its youth.

Through partnerships with organizations like the <strong id="">Atlantic City Arts Foundation</strong>, the <strong id="">Boys &amp; Girls Club</strong>, and support from groups like <strong id="">Levine Staller</strong>, <strong id="">Senator Gormley</strong>, <strong id="">AC Devco</strong>, and <strong id="">Chelsea EDC</strong>, the city is transforming lives—one creative opportunity at a time.</p><p id="">This is the power of community in action.

<p id="">In Atlantic City, small businesses are more than storefronts — they are family legacies, community staples, and drivers of economic strength. As part of the city’s ongoing Keep It Local campaign, the City of Atlantic City recently honored a beloved business that exemplifies endurance, quality, and community spirit: Gilchrist Restaurant, recipient of this year’s Resiliency Award.</p><p id="">Spearheaded by the city’s Department of Planning &amp; Development, the Keep It Local campaign shines a spotlight on the essential role small businesses play in shaping Atlantic City’s identity and future. From iconic eateries to corner stores, these businesses are a reflection of the city’s character, history, and commitment to growth.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:607px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="607px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6890c8601802e9cd246588b2_Screenshot%202025-08-04%20224904.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">A Story of Resilience and Roots</strong></p><p id="">Founded in 1946, Gilchrist Restaurant has long been a favorite for locals and visitors alike. With locations on both sides of town, it has become a go-to spot to start the day with a hearty breakfast or gather for a comforting lunch. Now owned by Denise Stamat and Michael Barham, Gilchrist continues to serve up the same casual charm and rich tradition that has kept it at the heart of the community for generations.</p><p id="">Receiving the Resiliency Award was more than just a recognition — it was a reflection of what it means to endure. “It’s an honor to be recognized,” said Barham. “For our family really — for family that isn’t here — that we’ve still been able to keep it going so long and be successful and grow.”</p><p id=""><strong>Why Atlantic City Believes in Local</strong></p><p id="">This recognition is part of a broader mission by the City of Atlantic City to uplift and empower its local entrepreneurs. Whether through grants, promotions, or public events, the city is making it clear: small business matters. These are the places where jobs are created, traditions are upheld, and dreams take root.</p><p id="">From longstanding institutions like Gilchrist to emerging start-ups, Atlantic City remains committed to creating an environment where business owners feel supported and where residents can take pride in shopping and dining locally.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:609px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="609px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6890c86a25ded153f2735c0e_Screenshot%202025-08-04%20224659.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">A City Where Businesses Thrive</strong></p><p id="">What sets Atlantic City apart is its resilience — not just in its people, but in its places. Every small business that withstands the test of time contributes to a deeper sense of place, purpose, and pride. And every recognition like the Resiliency Award is a reminder that success here is measured not just by profits, but by perseverance.</p><p id="">So, why live in Atlantic City?</p><p id="">Because it’s a city that believes in its own — a place where you can launch a business, grow a legacy, and find a community that shows up for you.</p><p id="">Whether it’s award-winning restaurants, family-run shops, or new ideas taking shape in old buildings, Atlantic City is a place to live, to work, and to thrive — one small business at a time.</p><p id="">For more about local business highlights and how to support the community, visit the City of Atlantic City’s “Keep It Local” campaign page.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">#LiveinAC &nbsp;| &nbsp;#WorkinAC &nbsp;| &nbsp;#InvestinAC</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[Students at Richmond Avenue School soared beyond textbooks this summer as they built and programmed drones through a dynamic STEM Summer Program.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 id=""><strong id="">Atlantic City Students Take Flight with Hands-On Drone Program</strong></h2><p id="">In Atlantic City, summer learning means more than books and classrooms — it means rising to new heights. Through an innovative STEM Drone Program at Richmond Avenue School, local students spent the season not only building drones, but also building confidence, collaboration, and career dreams.</p><p id="">This program was part of the city's broader effort to provide youth with immersive, future-ready experiences. Each summer, Atlantic City’s public schools continue to push learning beyond the traditional model — and this drone program proved just how powerful that can be.</p><h3 id="">Learning by Doing</h3><p id="">Instead of passively absorbing facts, students rolled up their sleeves and assembled commercial-grade drones from the ground up. Using Rub iQ kits, they learned to wire motors, install cameras, and troubleshoot complicated circuitry. It was engineering in action — tactile, technical, and teamwork-driven.</p><p id="">“These are the most complex drones we’ve ever used,” said instructor Nabi Chowdhury, who guided the students through every challenge. “They learned to problem-solve and adapt, even when tools didn’t work as expected.”</p><p id="">From flight simulators to hands-on assembly, every step of the program pushed students to think critically and work together. For some, the learning curve was steep — and that’s exactly what made it meaningful.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688cc3cab3df9eadef01c906_RAS%20Drones.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Richmond Avenue School Drone</figcaption></figure><h3 id="">Real-World Skills, Real Impact</h3><p id="">Whether improvising with pliers to solve a mechanical issue or working through communication breakdowns as a team, students learned that success isn’t just about following instructions. It’s about curiosity, perseverance, and trust in one another.</p><p id="">Principal Shontai Harris encouraged students to connect their learning to real-world possibilities. “Drones are used in roofing, insurance, public safety — all kinds of industries,” Harris said. “What they’re doing here is engineering, and it’s valuable for so many career paths.”</p><p id="">Students also explored flight simulators to build the coordination and decision-making skills needed for real drone piloting. The experience sparked new ideas, new interests, and new connections between classmates from different backgrounds.</p><h3 id="">A Community That Lifts Its Youth</h3><p id="">When technical issues arose due to GPS signal limitations downtown, students quickly adapted — switching to older drones and planning a future launch from a nearby beach. For educators like Allison Clark, the takeaway was clear: “They were taken out of their comfort zones and rose to the challenge.”</p><p id="">The program showed that when students are trusted with real tools and real responsibility, they respond with creativity, grit, and pride.</p><h3 id="">Why Atlantic City?</h3><p id="">This STEM Drone Program is just one example of how Atlantic City continues to invest in its youth — not only in summer but year-round. From hands-on STEM camps and creative arts programs to job training and scholarships, the city is building pathways to opportunity.</p><p id="">Programs like this remind us why Atlantic City is more than a destination — it’s a community. A place where young people can see themselves reflected in their schools, their neighborhoods, and their future.</p><p id="">It’s a city where students don’t just learn — they launch.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit:&nbsp;<strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<p id="">The Atlantic City Senior Services team continued expanding its reach this week by officially welcoming the Bella Condominiums community as the 19th senior building to join the city’s monthly programming.</p><p id="">Staff visited the Bella Condominiums to meet with residents face-to-face, answer questions, and provide a warm welcome into Atlantic City’s growing network of older adult services. It was a day of connection, conversation, and celebration — marking the beginning of a new chapter for both the residents and the city.</p><p id="">As part of the city’s broader commitment to supporting older adults, this inclusion means Bella residents now have access to a wide range of Senior Services programming, including health and wellness events, educational sessions, social opportunities, and more.</p><p id="">The visit was a celebration. Staff were greeted with smiles, stories, and a shared sense of excitement about what lies ahead. Many residents expressed enthusiasm about participating in programs that help them stay informed, active, and connected.</p><p id="">Adding Bella Condominiums to the Senior Services network reflects Atlantic City’s proactive approach to outreach. Rather than waiting for seniors to come to the city, the city goes directly to them, a model that continues to strengthen trust and increase participation.</p><p id="">Under the leadership of Mayor Marty Small, Sr. and the City of Atlantic City, these initiatives aim to ensure that every senior, regardless of where they live, has access to vital resources, opportunities, and community support.</p><p id="">The Atlantic City Senior Services team continues to grow its footprint in neighborhoods across the city, working closely with building managers and residents alike to customize offerings that reflect each community’s needs.</p><p id="">As Bella Condominiums officially joins the Senior Family, the City of Atlantic City reaffirms its dedication to creating a city where residents of all ages can thrive, together.</p><p>‍</p>

<description><![CDATA[The City of Atlantic City completed major improvements to Dolphin Field thanks to a $1.33 million grant from the Green Acres Program. Upgrades include new turf, lighting, fencing, and ADA accessibility, marking another step in the Small Administration’s commitment to better recreational facilities.

<p id=""><strong id="">A Stronger Field, A Stronger Future</strong></p><p id="">In Atlantic City, parks and playfields are more than green spaces, they are gathering places, practice grounds, and community anchors. And now, thanks to a $1.33 million Green Acres Program grant, Dolphin Field has been fully revitalized, ready to serve the next generation of athletes, families, and fans.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688b8268c3c8d6d8cc0fe203_526521473_1067930162188119_1875620655671318800_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Led by Mayor Marty Small, Sr., the transformation of Dolphin Field reflects the City of Atlantic City’s ongoing investment in public recreation. From the new turf and upgraded lighting, to renovated locker rooms, improved ADA accessibility, and modern fencing and landscaping, this project was designed to enhance both performance and safety — and to give residents a facility they can be proud of.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Where Community Comes to Play</strong></h2><p id="">More than just a sports field, Dolphin Field has long been a home for local football players, especially the Atlantic City Dolphins organization. When Mayor Small first announced the project alongside players, coaches, and supporters, it marked a renewed commitment to the role of sports in building confidence, teamwork, and belonging.</p><p id="">With these upgrades now completed, the space is once again ready to support weekend games, afterschool practices, and community gatherings. It’s a place where kids can chase dreams and families can cheer them on.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Local Support, Lasting Impact</strong></h2><p id="">The project would not have been possible without generous community partnerships. Local developer and Hard Rock Atlantic City owner Joe Jingoli previously contributed a new scoreboard and funding for earlier improvements, which remain an important part of the field today. The city has also applied for an additional $250,000 grant from the NFL to further enhance the facility.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688b828611d7b682ca216926_524659324_1067930755521393_4997715709914658123_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">This collaborative spirit between city leaders, local donors, and residents is what makes Atlantic City more than just a destination. It’s a place where people invest in each other.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">A City Built on Momentum</strong></h2><p id="">Dolphin Field is just one piece of a much larger movement under the Small Administration. Across Atlantic City, playgrounds are being modernized, parks are being beautified, and public spaces are being made more inclusive. These projects are not just about infrastructure, but about identity. It's about building a city where people want to <strong id="">live</strong><strong>, </strong><strong id="">work</strong><strong>, and grow.</strong></p><p id="">For families, it means safer, more welcoming spaces. For youth, it means more opportunity to stay active, connected, and inspired.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688b83e57b71b67674f00353_525201753_1067937378854064_4103213108825621297_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688b83ffaad22186cba7e119_526211921_1067930435521425_1311764368427189374_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h2 id=""><strong id="">Why Live in Atlantic City?</strong></h2><p id="">Because Atlantic City believes in its people.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Texas Avenue School in Atlantic City underwent a significant transformation, marking the beginning of a new chapter for the historic institution. As part of the Atlantic City School District’s broader investment in modernizing educational facilities, the school received extensive updates that aimed to rejuvenate both its appearance and functionality.</p><p id="">Visible from the moment one approached the building, the most striking change was the new paint job, featuring bold red accents that reflected the school’s official colors. The fresh coat of paint revitalized both the exterior and hallways, giving the building a vibrant, contemporary look while honoring its long-standing identity.</p><p id="">Beyond the surface, the school addressed deeper infrastructure needs. The third floor saw the removal of outdated lockers, some of which had been in place for decades. These were replaced with sleek, modern units, offering students more secure and accessible storage solutions. This improvement aligned with the district’s goal to create safer and more student-friendly environments.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68878fe482c48c7f7de032c7_IMG_9846.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Outdoors, the school added a new turf playground, providing a durable, safe, and visually appealing surface for students to enjoy physical activity. This upgrade was especially impactful in encouraging active play while reducing maintenance needs.</p><p id="">Principal Lina Gil expressed pride in the project, emphasizing its broader effect on the school culture. “These projects have a significant impact on staff and students by enhancing the physical environment and sense of pride in the school community,” Gil said. Her words reflected a shared sentiment among faculty and families who welcomed the updates as a sign of renewed commitment to quality education.</p><p id="">The upgrades extended to future plans as well. A brand-new kitchen was in development to improve food service operations and support more efficient meal preparation. This improvement would not only enhance daily logistics but also contribute to better nutritional experiences for students.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6887902f2144c92d8decad1c_IMG_9838.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The Texas Avenue School renovation was part of a larger district-wide initiative. Across Atlantic City, multiple schools received summer upgrades including HVAC system replacements, window installations, and classroom equipment enhancements, ensuring that students returned in the fall to facilities better suited for 21st-century learning.</p><p id="">As the first day of school approaches, Texas Avenue School stands as a powerful example of how thoughtful investment in infrastructure could support educational success. What had once been a century-old structure now felt like a beacon of renewal and readiness.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<h3 id=""><strong id="">Discipline. Leadership. Purpose.</strong></h3><p id=""><strong id="">‍</strong><br>Every summer, while some cities slow down, <strong id="">Atlantic City</strong> powers up with programs designed to shape its future. One of the most transformative examples is the <strong id="">Junior Police Academy</strong>—a two-week experience that gives local youth more than just a taste of law enforcement. It gives them the tools to lead.</p><p id="">Hosted by the <strong id="">Atlantic City Police Department</strong>, the Junior Police Academy is open to rising fifth and sixth graders, ages 11 and 12. It’s a structured yet inspiring summer journey that blends <strong id="">discipline</strong>, <strong id="">physical fitness</strong>, <strong id="">character-building</strong>, and <strong id="">teamwork</strong>, all wrapped in a supportive and motivating environment.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6887bc01b27912dfb6a6579a_524644532_1066220312359104_4780600068309002832_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">Where Futures Begin</strong></h3><p id=""><strong id="">‍</strong><br>Each year, dozens of students enroll not knowing what to expect. Some are nervous about the physical challenges. Others have never spoken in front of a group. But by the end of the program, they’re standing taller—more confident, more focused, and more connected to the idea that greatness comes through hard work.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:508px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="508px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688407607780f152d7fc20cf_Screenshot%202025-07-26%20063758.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:509px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="509px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6884077234412707ec1ee123_Screenshot%202025-07-26%20063710.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:506px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="506px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6884078067827ffe035cd76e_Screenshot%202025-07-26%20063725.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">From military drills and public speaking to locker inspections and leadership elections, every part of the academy is intentional.

<p id="">In Atlantic City, summer isn’t just a time for beaches and boardwalks, it’s also a season of opportunity. Through the <strong id="">Summer Youth Employment Program</strong>, the City of Atlantic City is giving local teens and young adults more than just a summer job. It’s offering them a launchpad into the future.</p><p id="">Spearheaded by the City of Atlantic City’s Youth Services Division, this initiative pairs local youth with hands-on job placements across the city, from government offices and community-based organizations. Participants are matched with opportunities that reflect their interests and career goals, building real-world skills in communication, leadership, and time management.</p><h3 id="">A City That Believes in Its Youth</h3><p id="">Now in its latest year, the Summer Youth Employment Program has grown into a cornerstone of the city’s youth development strategy. It’s part of Mayor Small’s broader commitment to creating pathways to success for Atlantic City’s next generation, especially those who may not otherwise have access to these types of opportunities.</p><p id="">In recent years, the program has supported hundreds of local youth with paid job experience, professional development workshops, financial literacy training, and mentorship — all while instilling a sense of civic pride and community engagement.</p><h3 id="">Real Jobs. Real Impact.</h3><p id="">What sets Atlantic City’s program apart is its emphasis on meaningful work. Participants are not observers — they are contributors. They help coordinate events, support local youth and seniors, assist in marketing campaigns, and even contribute to civic storytelling through platforms like <strong id="">GreatDayAtlanticCity.com</strong>.</p><p id="">These roles are more than resume-builders. They’re confidence-builders.</p><h3 id="">Why #LiveinAC?</h3><p id="">The Summer Youth Employment Program is just one example of why Atlantic City is more than a summer destination, it’s a community where young people can see a future for themselves.</p><p id="">From the Mayor’s $3M scholarship initiative and the Small Business Academy, to free summer events, beach concerts, and family programming across all neighborhoods, Atlantic City is evolving into a place where opportunity lives year-round.</p><h3 id="">A City in Motion</h3><p id="">Beyond the youth program, Atlantic City is investing in walkable neighborhoods, public art, affordable housing, and small business support. These efforts are reshaping the city’s reputation by showing the world what locals already know: Atlantic City is a place to live, work, and thrive.</p><p id="">This summer, as tourists soak in the sun, local teens will be busy making connections, gaining skills, and discovering their own power to shape the city they call home.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:400px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="400px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/688405a271118bb96b522180_LEA-9460.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id=""><strong id="">The City of Atlantic City is proud of its role in driving programs that break barriers and build bridges.

<description><![CDATA[The Brighton Botanical Garden bloomed into more than just a school project this summer. Through shared care, learning, and the joy of harvest, it became a symbol of growth, teamwork, and community pride.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">While many students at Brighton Avenue School welcomed their break, a different kind of learning continued to grow in the school’s front yard — within the vibrant space known as the Brighton Botanical Garden.</p><p id="">Rather than letting the flourishing garden go untended, the school’s Summer Program turned it into a daily hands-on learning hub. Staff and students arrived each morning to the scent of fresh herbs, the sight of leafy vegetables, and the chance to contribute to something meaningful.</p><p id="">The experience quickly became more than just gardening. It nurtured teamwork and ownership. “We all pitched in and helped,” said Principal Jason Grimes. “The parents from our school leadership team donated the dirt.” This generosity laid the foundation — quite literally — for a summer of discovery.</p><p id="">Students learned how to water, weed, and manage pests. For many, it was their first real introduction to sustainable gardening, teaching them patience, respect for nature, and the satisfaction of watching their work come to life. Even staff members unfamiliar with gardening found themselves learning side by side with the kids.</p><p id="">A major milestone came with the garden’s first harvest — thick, crisp cucumbers that matched the quality of any store-bought variety. “We taught the kids how to make a cucumber salad,” Grimes said, celebrating the garden’s transition from science lab to kitchen table.</p><p id="">The garden became a bridge between home and school. Parents who had helped early on with soil and supplies returned throughout the summer to weed, water, and check in on the garden’s progress. Their continued involvement turned the project into a true community collaboration.</p><p id="">Looking ahead, the Summer Program prepared the space for the upcoming school year. Staff and students began to plant cover crops, apply mulch, and ready the soil for fall’s next big goal: harvesting pumpkins before the winter chill sets in.</p><p id="">What began as a seasonal activity had evolved into a symbol of what’s possible when students, educators, and families work together. The Brighton Botanical Garden became a shared success — a living, growing testament to resilience, creativity, and community spirit.</p><p id="">“This is truly a community effort,” Principal Grimes reflected — a statement that echoed through every vine, root, and bite of cucumber.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id=""> Photo Credit: <strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[The City of Atlantic City has begun construction on an $8.5 million Bulkhead Replacement Project in the Chelsea neighborhood, continuing its mission to improve storm resiliency. The project, funded through a grant from the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, is a key component of a broader strategy to protect vulnerable communities from future flooding.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">As part of its long-term vision to combat the growing threats of climate change and coastal flooding, the City of Atlantic City officially began construction on an $8.5 million Bulkhead Replacement Project in the Chelsea neighborhood on July 23, 2025. The project is one of many ongoing efforts aimed at making the city more resilient against storms and tidal surges.</p><p id="">The construction, managed by Richard E. Pierson Company, included replacing public bulkheads along the back bay from Albany Avenue to Morris Avenue. In addition to the structural upgrades, improvements were made to stormwater outfalls, sidewalks were restored, and new trees were planted, adding both function and aesthetic value to the neighborhood.</p><p id="">The project is funded by a grant from the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) and reflects the city’s strategic investment in community protection. Mayor Marty Small, Sr. emphasized that this initiative is aligned with his administration’s promise to prioritize resiliency, while also being mindful of taxpayer interests.</p><p id="">“The Small Administration has made a commitment to sure up our resiliency here in the Great City of Atlantic City with the best interest of our taxpayers in mind,” stated Mayor Small. “Through various projects like this, we are not only protecting our residents and businesses, but we are also investing in the future of our community.”</p><p id="">Beyond Chelsea, the city has launched or planned several other major infrastructure upgrades. A $16 million upgrade of the Atlantis Avenue Pump Station is expected to be completed by the end of the year. This station will help manage stormwater across Midtown and Inlet neighborhoods, reducing the risk of localized flooding.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68814953084a8a02515990fe_unnamed%20(11).jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6881496030c347613837b706_unnamed%20(12).jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">In addition, the Ducktown Bulkhead Replacement Project and Fisherman’s Park Pump Station upgrades are scheduled to begin before the year ends. Both initiatives are partially funded by the U.S. Economic Development Agency, and represent a continuation of the city’s partnership with federal and state entities to secure funding for critical projects.</p><p id="">Jim Rutala, the city’s grant consultant from Rutala Associates, noted that the foundation for this comprehensive resiliency strategy was developed as early as 2012. He emphasized that the real momentum came after Mayor Small took office, resulting in a wave of successful grant applications and carefully executed infrastructure projects.</p><p id="">According to City Engineering Director Uzo Ahiarakwe, the Chelsea Bulkhead Replacement is just one piece of a broader puzzle. “Under this current administration there has been a strong emphasis on resiliency and addressing quality of life concerns. Chelsea bulkhead Replacement is one part of a comprehensive package in which we’re trying to address each and every component of resiliency.”</p><p id="">Already, previous phases of bulkhead improvements have been completed in Lower Chelsea, Chelsea Heights, and Gardner’s Basin. Additionally, most of the check valves regulating stormwater discharge have been upgraded. The city also celebrated the nearing completion of the $60 million Inlet Seawall and boardwalk project, providing a vital line of defense for the Inlet neighborhood and linking Ocean Casino Resort to Gardner’s Basin Park.</p><p id="">Looking forward, the city is preparing the next generation of resiliency projects. FEMA-funded studies are underway in Bungalow Park, Venice Park, Chelsea/Ducktown, and Chelsea Heights, which will inform future infrastructure and environmental improvements as funding becomes available. These studies demonstrate Atlantic City’s commitment to long-term preparedness in the face of environmental challenges.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City Senior Services team took a bold and refreshing step with their programming by going beyond city limits—and even state lines. In a unique and spirited outing, the group boarded the Great Day Bus and embarked on an exciting journey that blended relaxation, shopping, and stunning scenery.</p><p id="">Their destination? Rehoboth Beach, Delaware—a bustling coastal town known for its beaches, outlets, and friendly charm. But before hitting the shopping haven, the seniors enjoyed an unforgettable experience aboard the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, gliding smoothly across the shimmering water with smiles on their faces and excitement in the air.</p><p id="">The ferry ride itself was a highlight. With clear skies, calm waters, and a gentle breeze, the crossing felt more like a mini-cruise than a commute. Spirits were high, and many took in the scenic views while chatting and sharing laughs on deck.</p><p id="">Once in Delaware, the group headed straight to the outlet malls of Rehoboth Beach, where deals awaited and bags quickly filled. The seniors explored shops at their own pace, enjoying both the thrill of bargain hunting and the fun of bonding with fellow participants.</p><p id="">The outing was a chance for many to break routine, make new memories, and experience a change of scenery. For some, it was their first time traveling outside New Jersey in years, and the sense of adventure brought a spark of joy that lit up every face.</p><p id="">Staff members made sure everyone felt supported and safe throughout the day, providing assistance, encouragement, and plenty of laughter along the way. It wasn’t just a shopping trip—it was a celebration of life, community, and connection.</p><p id="">The weather couldn’t have been more perfect. With blue skies and gorgeous temperatures, it felt like the universe itself was cheering on the day’s success.</p><p id="">By late afternoon, the group made their way back, tired but happy, their hearts and shopping bags full. The return ferry ride served as a peaceful wind-down, with stories and photos shared, and a quiet sense of contentment settling in.</p><p id="">This adventure proved once again that Atlantic City Senior Services is committed to creating experiences that go beyond expectations—and sometimes, beyond borders.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Atlantic City Senior Services</strong></p>

<p id="">While Atlantic City is widely celebrated for its beaches, boardwalk, shops, and casinos, it also holds some of the most serene and scenic gardens waiting to be discovered.

<p id="">The City of Atlantic City turned its spotlight on the future by hosting a powerful and emotional celebration at the historic Steel Pier. The occasion honored 113 recipients of the Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship, recognizing the academic achievements, dreams, and determination of local students who represent the city’s next generation of leaders.</p><p id="">The event was a true community moment, filled with pride, hope, and gratitude. Students stood proudly alongside their families as they accepted their ceremonial checks, posed for photos with Mayor Marty Small, Sr., and shared in the excitement of a milestone that brings them one step closer to achieving their academic and career goals.</p><p id="">Each scholarship, valued at up to $10,000, was awarded to eligible Atlantic City residents. The recipients included a diverse mix of students—incoming college freshmen, current undergraduates, and those pursuing Masters, Doctorate, or Trade School education. This year’s group represented a wide range of aspirations: future nurses, engineers, educators, entrepreneurs, and more.</p><p id="">Funds were split into two disbursements—half for Fall 2025, and half for Spring 2026—to ensure continued support throughout the school year. While the checks handed out during the event were symbolic, the real funds were sent directly to the recipients’ academic institutions, reinforcing accountability and purpose.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:640px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="640px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/686550c680a6ba890c5f3fb1_scholarship-winners-2025.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The choice of Steel Pier as the venue was symbolic. With its rich history and iconic status, the Pier represented resilience, renewal, and the city’s ability to evolve while staying grounded in community values. Against the backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean, the event reflected Atlantic City’s enduring spirit and its bright future.</p><p id="">In his address, Mayor Marty Small, Sr. spoke from the heart. He shared how deeply committed his administration is to uplifting youth, removing barriers to education, and building pathways to success. Since the scholarship program launched in 2023, it has awarded hundreds of Atlantic City residents with direct financial support—made possible through the city's allocation of American Rescue Plan funds under the "Addressing Educational Disparity" category.</p><p id="">This year’s awards expanded eligibility beyond just Atlantic City High School students, opening doors for all residents regardless of what high school they attend or attended. That inclusiveness contributed to a record number of applications in 2025, demonstrating a growing awareness and demand for educational opportunity in the city.</p><p id="">The presence of parents, educators, mentors, and city leaders made the event even more meaningful. They served as living proof of the power of a community that comes together to invest in its youth. Their cheers, applause, and tearful moments reminded everyone of what this celebration truly stood for—opportunity, equity, and hope.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1183px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1183px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687faf63e40c652b621444b4_Screenshot%202025-07-22%20215239.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">#LiveinAC: A City That Believes in Its Students</h3><p id="">Beyond the celebration itself, the event was a powerful call to action. It reminded residents, alumni, and stakeholders that supporting education is a shared responsibility. Whether through mentoring, sponsorship, or simply sharing resources, everyone has a role to play in shaping the future of Atlantic City’s young people.</p><p id="">By honoring these scholars, the city not only celebrated achievement but also sent a strong message: Atlantic City believes in its students. That belief is now being carried by 113 individuals who will go on to pursue their education with confidence and pride.</p><h3 id="">#InvestinAC: Scholarships That Change Lives</h3><p id="">The 2025 Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship Celebration was more than just an event—it was a statement of purpose. It was a reminder that when a city invests in education, it plants the seeds for lasting change, not just in one life—but across generations.</p><p id="">Programs like this make Atlantic City more than a beach destination—they make it a place where families can thrive, where young people can see a future, and where investment in people drives progress.</p><p id="">To see highlights and photos from this inspiring evening, check out the full photo gallery at the link below.</p><h3 id=""><a href="https://www.acnj.gov/gallery#nanogallery%2Fphoto-gallery%2F72177720327269413" id="">Event Photos</a></h3><p id="">‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">#LiveinAC &nbsp;| &nbsp;#WorkinAC &nbsp;| &nbsp;#InvestinAC</strong></p><p id="">‍</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Week 3 of Great Day Summer Camp, hosted by the City of Atlantic City Multicultural Services, offered a full lineup of exploration, creativity, and hands-on fun for campers of all ages. Each day introduced a new theme and set of activities designed to inspire, educate, and engage — and the results were nothing short of amazing.</p><p id="">Monday kicked off with Nature Day, where campers painted planter pots and planted their own succulents to take home. With dirt on their hands and smiles on their faces, they learned the importance of caring for living things and the joy of nurturing their own plants.</p><p id="">On Tuesday, the camp moved into a more artistic space with a visit to the Noyes Arts Garage. The spotlight was on Vincent van Gogh, as campers experimented with the impasto technique and created textured paintings inspired by the master himself. The creativity was flowing, and the results were colorful and deeply personal works of art.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1137px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1137px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687a8438598ba970c29f40bc_Screenshot%202025-07-19%20012750.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Wednesday brought an extra dose of adventure. Our K–2 campers stepped into fantasy at Storybook Land, where fairy tales came alive through rides and attractions. Meanwhile, our 3rd–6th graders experienced the awe of the Atlantic City Airshow, watching jets soar across the sky in an unforgettable aerial performance.</p><p id="">The week wrapped up with a trip to the Cape May Zoo on Thursday. Surrounded by animals and lush greenery, campers enjoyed an up-close look at wildlife while learning about conservation and animal habitats. From lions to lemurs, every encounter was met with excitement and curiosity.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1262px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1262px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687a844e3c6efe403a318f34_Screenshot%202025-07-19%20012738.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Every day of camp was more than just fun — it was a chance for campers to express themselves, connect with others, and explore the world around them. The thoughtful programming ensured that each child walked away with both memories and meaningful experiences.</p><p id="">The week’s theme may have been about nature, art, and adventure, but the heart of it was connection — to creativity, to community, and to each other.</p><p id="">It truly was a Great Day week. We’re so proud of what our campers accomplished and experienced, and we can’t wait to share what’s in store for Week 4.</p><p id="">Stay tuned — the adventure continues!</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Atlantic City Multicultural Services</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[Uptown School Complex underwent major upgrades this summer, including HVAC improvements, a new roof, and interior renovations. While work progressed, the school community embraced collaboration and creativity through shared summer programs with Pennsylvania Avenue School.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Uptown School Complex in Atlantic City underwent major capital improvements this summer as part of a district-wide initiative to enhance infrastructure and learning environments. These upgrades marked a transformative phase in the school’s development and demonstrated a deep commitment to student success, safety, and innovation.</p><p id="">Completed projects included the installation of a new roof, significant upgrades to the HVAC and boiler systems, and the replacement of interior doors. Each improvement was aimed at increasing energy efficiency, building sustainability, and maintaining a safe learning space for students and staff alike.</p><p id="">“These capital improvements at Uptown School Complex reflected our district’s ongoing commitment to providing safe spaces where students could learn and thrive,” said Superintendent of Schools Dr. La’Quetta S. Small.</p><p id="">While construction was underway, Uptown’s summer school program was temporarily relocated to Pennsylvania Avenue School. This transition created opportunities for stronger inter-school cooperation and led to a shared sense of purpose among educators and families. “I was incredibly proud of the collaboration between our school leaders, teachers, and families to ensure uninterrupted summer learning,” said Dr. Small.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1076px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1076px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6877bac41d2f28da259bd22e_Screenshot%202025-07-16%20224356.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The relocation allowed both schools to jointly launch new initiatives, including a Visual and Performing Arts program. The highlight was a joint production of <em id="">101 Dalmatians Kids</em>, which featured a combined cast and creative team. “It helped build camaraderie rather than competition,” said Uptown School Complex Principal Dr. Ananda Davis-Wright.</p><p id="">STEM education also flourished during the summer session. Principal Thomas Biggins of Pennsylvania Avenue School noted that students embraced STEM “not as an assignment, but as a passion.”</p><p id="">Both schools also operated Extended School Year (ESY) programs, which served students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). These programs provided consistency and helped minimize summer learning loss. “It helped keep some of our exceptional students in their routines,” Biggins said.</p><p id="">Throughout the summer, Dr. Davis-Wright managed responsibilities across both sites, beginning her mornings at Uptown to supervise transportation and continuing her day from a temporary office inside Pennsylvania Avenue School’s media center.</p><p id="">The upgrades at Uptown were part of Atlantic City Public Schools’ broader efforts to modernize facilities during the summer break. “These improvements were appreciated by all,” said Davis-Wright. “The **teachers will love it. The students will love it. And it addressed parents’ concerns.”</p><p id="">As the final construction work wrapped up, the spirit of teamwork and adaptability showcased how Atlantic City Public Schools continues to prioritize safety, community, and educational excellence. “It was a massive job,” Davis-Wright said. “You don’t realize how big it is until you watch it taking place.”</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[Summer brought a wave of transformation to Atlantic City Public Schools, with the long-awaited demolition of New Jersey Avenue School paving the way for a brand-new administration building. The initiative reflected the district’s continued commitment to modernization, community needs, and long-term infrastructure improvement.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">While students and teachers enjoyed a well-earned break after the school year ended in June, Atlantic City Public Schools launched into a season of progress and preparation. The summer of 2025 was marked by critical upgrades, facility improvements, and one of the district’s most historic transitions—the demolition of the New Jersey Avenue School.</p><p id="">Located in the heart of the city, the New Jersey Avenue School had been closed since 2012, when the Pennsylvania Avenue School opened its doors. Later that same year, the building sustained severe damage during Hurricane Sandy, leaving it structurally compromised and unusable. For over a decade, the structure remained a silent witness to the city’s evolution—until this summer.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687514ac1ceaf52d0fdbe7ca_515439349_1274583634671386_7688235278503441965_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""> The district began preparing the site for a fresh start. Built in 1925, the school was set to be cleared to make room for a state-of-the-art administration building that will serve the entire district.</p><p id="">"We have committed to building an administration building," said Board of Education President Shay Steele. “This board, in conjunction with the leadership of Dr. Small, has made this project a priority. We are excited to fulfill the wishes of the community and also provide the district with a building of its own. This has been part of our mission, and upon completion we will have a state-of-the-art facility.”</p><p id="">According to Dr. Small, who began her teaching career at the New Jersey Avenue School in 2003, the new structure would centralize district operations and provide improved access for families, staff, and the community. She emphasized that the project represented more than just new construction—it embodied the district’s values of equity, excellence, and long-term investment.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/687514b795eb97899ada80b5_516827840_1274583638004719_3528606820960726490_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">“This is part of our ongoing commitment to modernize facilities and strengthen our infrastructure,” Dr. Small stated. “We want to ensure that both our students and our staff have the resources and support they need to succeed.”</p><p id="">Beyond the demolition, multiple summer projects were underway across the district. From classroom upgrades to campus repairs and efficiency improvements, the quiet summer months provided the perfect opportunity to enhance the learning environment before students returned in September.</p><p id="">The momentum reflected the district’s proactive approach to maintaining safe, functional, and inspiring schools. By taking advantage of the summer downtime, the district ensured that learning spaces were not just ready—but better than ever.</p><p id="">As the weeks progressed, Atlantic City Public Schools continued to update the community on ongoing projects and initiatives. The demolition of the New Jersey Avenue School served as both a symbolic and practical milestone—a reminder that even when classrooms are empty, the work of building a brighter future for Atlantic City never stopped.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Mark Tyler | Atlantic City Public Schools</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[The CRDA launched a $2 million Microloan Program to support small-scale development projects in Atlantic City, offering up to $500,000 per loan to empower local entrepreneurs. This initiative reflected CRDA’s commitment to inclusive economic growth and accessible financing.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) officially launched a $2 million Microloan Program on June 30, 2025, marking a significant milestone in Atlantic City’s economic development efforts. This initiative was designed to support small-scale projects that often struggle to obtain conventional financing, opening new doors for local businesses and developers.</p><p id="">With loans of up to $500,000 per application, the program aimed to cover up to 50% of eligible project costs, such as construction, equipment purchases, and permits. The program offered flexible five-to-ten-year terms and competitive interest rates, helping ensure sustainability and accessibility for small business owners.</p><p id="">The microloan initiative aligned with CRDA’s broader mission of economic revitalization, particularly in areas that needed targeted support. According to CRDA Executive Director Eric Scheffler, the program showcased the Authority’s “continued commitment to fostering economic growth in Atlantic City.” He emphasized that creating easier funding pathways was essential for enabling local businesses to thrive.</p><p id="">Lance Landgraf, CRDA’s Director of Planning and Development, highlighted that the loan process was structured to serve those most in need. Applicants were required to demonstrate efforts to secure traditional financing, invest at least 20% equity, and provide personal guarantees. This ensured that the funding went to viable, well-considered ventures poised to benefit the community.</p><p id="">The microloan program was set to begin accepting applications on July 1, 2025, and was scheduled to run through December 31, 2025, or until funds were fully allocated. Importantly, all construction financed through the program was mandated to comply with prevailing wage requirements, reinforcing the CRDA’s commitment to ethical development standards.</p><p id="">CRDA also committed to evaluating the program’s performance after six months. Depending on outcomes, the Authority would consider extending or expanding the initiative to further fuel Atlantic City’s development momentum.</p><p id="">This program was part of a broader shift in CRDA’s strategy. Once focused on statewide projects, CRDA has since evolved into a key economic engine for Atlantic City, responsible not only for financing but also for land use regulation, tourism marketing, and community development. The Authority’s ongoing efforts have already spurred nearly $2 billion in investments across over 400 projects, with $1.8 billion invested directly in Atlantic City.</p><p id="">The launch of the Microloan Program reaffirmed CRDA’s dedication to empowering local businesses and fostering a more resilient, inclusive economy. By focusing on access, equity, and smart investment, the Authority continued to play a vital role in shaping the future of Atlantic City.</p><h5 id="">For more details and application procedures, interested parties were encouraged to visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.njcrda.com" id="">www.njcrda.com</a> or contact CRDA’s Planning and Development Division at (609) 347-0500.</h5><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit: <strong id="">Casino Reinvestment Development Authority</strong></p>

<p id="">The City of Atlantic City marked a significant milestone with the opening of its first official Dog Park, giving local residents and their furry companions a dedicated space to enjoy the outdoors. The Grand Opening event took place on June 26, 2025, at S. New Hampshire and Pacific Avenues in Altman Park, and featured a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Mayor Marty Small, Sr., city officials, and representatives from the Inlet Community Development Corporation (CDC).</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685e9db3297e5a594e7a7772_512734424_1041325798181889_5219920099845788511_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">This new dog-friendly facility was created to promote exercise, socialization, and a sense of community among dog owners. Designed with both safety and enjoyment in mind, the park consisted of two separate play areas: one for dogs over 40 pounds, and another for those up to 40 pounds.</p><p id="">Each section included obstacle course equipment, open spaces for running, and plenty of room for dogs to interact. The surfaces featured a combination of grass and mulch to support comfort and safety while dogs played.</p><p id="">To help maintain cleanliness, the Dog Park was equipped with multiple waste stations, including bags provided on site.

This schedule was set to help manage activity in the park and promote responsible usage.</p><p id="">The project was a collaboration between several city departments.

<description><![CDATA[The Atlantic City Police Athletic League, Police Department, and community leaders came together to unveil a new wrestling mat and launch the city's first coed youth wrestling team—the Atlantic City Lions—providing local youth with a powerful outlet for discipline, strength, and self-worth.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City took a major step forward in youth development and community engagement with the launch of the Atlantic City Lions, the city's first-ever youth wrestling team. In a joint effort between the Atlantic City Police Athletic League (PAL), the Atlantic City Police Department, and the Atlantic City Police Foundation, the initiative was made official with the donation of a brand-new 40-by-42-foot wrestling mat featuring bold logos for PAL, ACPD, and the newly formed team.</p><p id="">The mat, installed at the PAL building on New York Avenue, symbolized much more than a place to train—it represented opportunity, mentorship, and the beginning of a new athletic chapter for the city’s youth. Coach Marcus Holmes, an Atlantic City firefighter and former wrestler, leads the program with a mission to unite local kids, give them an outlet beyond the streets, and teach them valuable life skills such as resilience, patience, and self-discipline.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1201px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1201px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685ae7c73a33689b8e17c077_Screenshot%202025-06-25%20020022.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The team is coed and expected to draw over 50 youth athletes from across the city. Young wrestlers like Edward Balderas Cruz and Giovanny Jimenez shared how the sport has already impacted them, improving their strength, speed, confidence, and commitment.</p><p id="">For Lt. Will Santiago, PAL’s executive director and Atlantic City native, the project is deeply personal. Recognizing that many local youth gravitate only toward football or basketball, Santiago said introducing wrestling offers an important alternative path that can keep kids engaged, healthy, and off the streets.</p><p id="">Police Chief James Sarkos, who wrestled in high school, was instrumental in making the vision a reality. Citing his own experience with the sport’s positive influence on self-esteem and focus, he emphasized the importance of finding the right coach and the right setting to build long-term enthusiasm. Sarkos also noted the sport’s potential to open doors to college scholarships and future opportunities.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1388px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1388px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/685ae8494614e2207bb19d74_Screenshot%202025-06-25%20020205.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz applauded the effort, calling the turnout and investment “tremendous” and highlighting PAL’s ongoing commitment to enriching the lives of young people. The PAL building continues to offer a variety of activities, including track, boxing, flag football, basketball, and a computer room for schoolwork—further proving that this isn’t just about sports, but about building a supportive environment where children can thrive.</p><p id="">With strong community support, a passionate coaching staff, and a clear mission, the Atlantic City Lions have already begun shaping the city’s next generation—on the mat and beyond.</p>

<description><![CDATA[Mayor Marty Small’s $3 million scholarship initiative is changing lives in Atlantic City. In its third year, the program awarded 113 scholarships, supporting high school grads, college students, trade school enrollees, and advanced degree seekers. It’s a bold investment in local talent and a powerful example of how Atlantic City is building a community where people can live, learn, and thrive.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City isn't just a place to vacation, it's a city where futures are built. Through a bold, three-year, $3 million commitment led by Mayor Marty Small, Sr., the city is changing the trajectory for students and families by making higher education and career training more accessible than ever before.</p><p id="">Now in its third and final year, the Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship Program awarded 113 scholarships of up to $10,000 each to Atlantic City residents in 2025. That’s more than the expected 100 scholarships typically granted per year, thanks to remaining funds. The scholarships are funded through the American Rescue Plan under the Addressing Educational Disparity category.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68531d9da90fa6721b0b43a9_achs3.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68531e6174b37601139ed4ab_achs1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">#LiveinAC: A City That Invests in Its Youth</strong></h3><p id="">This initiative sends a powerful message to Atlantic City families: your city sees you, believes in you, and is investing in your success. For residents, especially those balancing financial challenges, this kind of support makes the dream of college or trade school not only imaginable but attainable. It also makes Atlantic City a desirable place to raise a family, where education isn’t just encouraged, it’s funded.</p><p id="">The scholarships are open to all Atlantic City residents, regardless of which high school they currently attend or previously attended. This inclusive approach ensures the program reaches students across the city, from recent high school grads and current college students to those pursuing advanced degrees and trade certifications.</p><h3 id="">#WorkinAC: Building the Talent Pipeline</h3><p id="">This year’s breakdown reflects a broad investment in Atlantic City’s growing talent pool:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">44 scholarships</strong> for high school graduates entering college</li><li id=""><strong id="">52 scholarships</strong> for current college students advancing to sophomore, junior, or senior year</li><li id=""><strong id="">11 scholarships</strong> for graduate students pursuing a Master’s or Doctorate</li><li id=""><strong id="">6 scholarships</strong> for students entering trade school</li></ul><p id="">By supporting not only traditional four-year college pathways but also trade programs and advanced degrees, the city is laying the groundwork for a diverse and skilled workforce that meets the demands of today’s economy. Several past scholarship recipients have already returned to work in Atlantic City, contributing their talents to the local government and business community.</p><h3 id="">#InvestinAC: Community-Funded, Future-Focused</h3><p id="">This scholarship program represents more than a generous giveaway. It’s a strategic investment in long-term prosperity. When residents are equipped with education and job training, they are more likely to stay in the city, launch businesses, purchase homes, and give back to their community. That kind of growth doesn’t just benefit individuals, it uplifts entire neighborhoods.</p><p id="">With nearly 300 applications submitted this year, the program's rising popularity is proof that Atlantic City residents are eager for opportunity. The selection committee, composed of trusted local leaders, carefully reviews applications and essays to ensure that scholarships go to those most ready to make an impact.</p><p id="">As Mayor Small noted, while this marks the final year of the original three-year commitment, efforts are already underway to ensure the program continues. In Atlantic City, investing in the next generation isn’t a short-term promise. It’s a long-term plan.</p><p>‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">#LiveinAC | #WorkinAC | #InvestinAC | #GreatDayAtlanticCity</strong></p>

<p id="">Pennsylvania Avenue School proudly held its 8th Grade Stepping Up Ceremony on Friday, June 13, 2025, in the school’s cafetorium.

Educators, families, and students gathered in support of the Class of 2025, applauding not only academic milestones but also the strength and character built over time.</p><p id="">Principal Thomas Biggins opened the program with a speech encouraging students to lead with kindness and work hard. He reminded students that “excellence doesn’t mean being perfect,” but instead showing up, trying again, and building strong habits. His words underscored the importance of perseverance, urging students to keep striving—even when the path ahead is challenging.</p><p id="">“Keep grinding,” Biggins said. “Your hard work will open doors you can’t even see yet.” He also emphasized that compassion and empathy are the hallmarks of true leadership. “Being kind makes you strong,” he said. “It makes you a leader, not a follower.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6851788be0900e813f639419_IMG_8814.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id=""><strong id="">Salutatorian Ayana Frierson</strong> </figcaption></figure><p id="">Salutatorian Ayana Frierson delivered a moving speech about balancing academics and athletics.

<description><![CDATA[Atlantic City’s Clean Communities Initiative returned for summer 2025, allowing residents to earn money while cleaning up their neighborhoods. The program offered a $200 monthly stipend to groups that participated in regular cleanups through October.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City’s Clean Communities Initiative officially wrapped its fourth consecutive summer of promoting neighborhood pride and environmental stewardship. Led by the Department of Public Works, the program returned in 2025 and once again provided local residents with the opportunity to earn money while actively improving their own communities.</p><p id="">Throughout the summer, the Public Works Department rotated through different Atlantic City wards daily, conducting neighborhood cleanups and inviting the public to join the effort. This hands-on program was designed to inspire civic responsibility and a cleaner, safer Atlantic City for all. Residents responded with enthusiasm and a shared commitment to the cause.</p><p id="">Groups of five or more were invited to participate by committing to clean at least four blocks twice a month. In return, these groups received a $200 monthly stipend, making the initiative a win-win: residents benefited financially while the city saw a significant reduction in litter and debris. Participants were provided with trash bags, gloves, grabbers, and safety vests to ensure an efficient and safe cleanup process.</p><p id="">The program also emphasized accessibility. Interested residents were able to collect applications at the Public Works Office in Room 604 at City Hall, where they also received further instructions. All inquiries during the program period were directed to Clean Communities Coordinator Angela Pittman.</p><p id="">The 2025 initiative officially ran through October 1, 2025, giving residents a full summer to take part. The city’s website, <a target="_new" href="http://www.acnj.gov" id="">www.acnj.gov</a>, hosted the initial daily cleanup schedule and other updates throughout the season, allowing participants to stay informed and engaged.</p><p id="">Beyond the monetary incentive, many participants cited a sense of pride and ownership in their neighborhoods as the most rewarding aspect. The program succeeded in not only cleaning the streets but also in strengthening bonds between neighbors and fostering a collective sense of responsibility.</p><p id="">This summer’s Clean Communities program also served as a platform for youth engagement. Several local youth groups and student organizations joined in, turning their summer break into a meaningful community service experience.</p><p id="">City officials expressed satisfaction with the turnout and effectiveness of the program. They noted that litter levels were visibly reduced and public response was overwhelmingly positive, setting the stage for continued growth of the initiative in future years.</p><p id="">The 2025 program demonstrated that with a shared goal and a small incentive, community transformation is achievable. Atlantic City residents once again showed that they are ready and willing to step up for the betterment of their neighborhoods.</p><p id="">‍</p>

<description><![CDATA[The City of Atlantic City officially opened the Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver Plaza, honoring the late Lieutenant Governor while introducing a beautifully redesigned, secure, and sustainable space outside City Hall.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">On June 5, 2025, the City of Atlantic City, in partnership with the State of New Jersey, proudly celebrated the grand opening of the Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver Plaza. Located outside City Hall, this new space was named in honor of the late Lieutenant Governor, a trailblazer who left a lasting mark on New Jersey’s political and civic landscape.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr. led the ribbon-cutting ceremony alongside New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Commissioner Jaquelyn Suarez, members of Sheila Oliver’s family, and a gathering of City, County, and State officials. The event marked both a celebration of legacy and the completion of a major public space renovation.</p><p id="">This project not only paid tribute to Lt. Governor Sheila Oliver but also significantly improved the public’s experience at City Hall. The main entrance, closed since construction began in spring 2024, was reopened with a covered walkway and a new security gate, enhancing both convenience and safety.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68430170415f895084493a57_504188450_1024861109828358_8295916882888555672_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Further security upgrades included improved lighting across the courtyard, with lanterns added to the exterior walls, and reconfigured main and employee entrance doors to streamline access and safety. Sheila Oliver’s name, now prominently etched above the entrance walkway, along with her image and signage throughout the plaza, added a powerful visual tribute.</p><p id="">The plaza also received extensive aesthetic improvements. Visitors can now enjoy built-in benches, a thoughtfully designed rain garden, an elegant marble fountain, and a pergola that brings charm and shade to the space. Lush new trees, shrubs, and grass were planted to soften the urban setting and create a welcoming environment.</p><p id="">The building itself received attention as well. Existing exterior walls were power washed and repainted, restoring their original brightness and contributing to the refreshed look and feel of the City Hall complex.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6843018d8174a929c167fb94_504183632_1024861116495024_5997697757120594477_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">To make the plaza more walkable, pedestrian space was expanded across the courtyard. These wider walking paths made the area more accessible and navigable for visitors, staff, and residents passing through the site.</p><p id="">In addition to the courtyard renovations, the City Hall parking lot was repaved and redesigned. A new parking attendant booth was installed at the South Carolina Avenue entrance, further improving visitor management and traffic flow.</p><p id="">Lastly, in line with the city’s growing commitment to renewable energy, six Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations were scheduled to be installed later in the month—adding a forward-thinking, sustainable element to the site.</p><p id="">The opening of the Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver Plaza marked more than the completion of a construction project—it symbolized respect for a remarkable leader and a renewed vision for civic space in Atlantic City. The plaza now stands as a lasting reminder of her legacy and the city’s dedication to accessibility, safety, and sustainability.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credits to: <strong id="">Ed Lea / City of Atlantic City</strong></p>

<p id="">The 12th Annual Boat Races at Atlantic City High School were a resounding success, drawing cheers from classmates, teachers, and visitors as students put their engineering and physics knowledge to the test on the water.</p><p id="">Held on campus in Atlantic City, NJ, this year’s event celebrated creativity, teamwork, and scientific application through one of the school’s most exciting traditions. Students from Honors Physics and AP Physics 1 classes participated, using principles they learned throughout the year to design and race their boats across a makeshift course.</p><p id="">The competition was not only about speed, but also about design, buoyancy, and innovation. Every team had the opportunity to present their vessels, explain their engineering choices, and demonstrate how physics could be applied in a practical, hands-on challenge.</p><p id="">The highlight of the event came when a new school record was set by Zuzanna Turska ’25, a two-time champion, and her teammates. Their boat sped across the finish line faster than any in previous years, cementing their names in the school’s physics legacy. Their victory proved to be a perfect blend of technical skill and effective collaboration.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1440px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1440px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842ffa1d843c8bd4da564c2_503858217_18228357895293165_3238898973631612657_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The first-place prize went to “Puff Mobile”, created by students in the Honors Physics class. Known for its sleek design and aerodynamic efficiency, the boat outpaced its competitors while remaining remarkably stable during the race.</p><p id="">Second and third place were awarded to “Armstrong” and “Mayflower”, both entries from AP Physics 1. These boats demonstrated unique structural solutions and a deep understanding of force, motion, and fluid dynamics.</p><p id="">The event was as educational as it was entertaining, giving students the chance to engage with physics in a way that was both interactive and memorable. Teachers and spectators alike were impressed by the ingenuity on display and the energy students brought to the challenge.</p><p id="">The race also served as an opportunity for students to practice problem-solving, collaboration, and communication, all key components of STEM education. Whether their boats placed or not, every participant walked away with valuable experience and a sense of pride.</p><p id="">A big thank you went out to all who came to support the event, especially the teachers who organized it and the students who made it possible. The 12th Annual Boat Races stood as a testament to what students can achieve when given the space to explore, build, and compete.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit to: <strong id="">Atlantic City High School</strong></p>

<p id="">The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School Complex in Atlantic City recently hosted a lively and unforgettable event — MLK Fun Day 2025 — that brought students, staff, and the community together for a full day of celebration, fun, and connection.</p><p id="">Serving both as a reward for students who excelled throughout the year and encouragement for those needing a boost, the day reflected the school’s commitment to both achievement and inclusivity. Principal Jodi Burroughs shared that the main goal was to allow kids to enjoy themselves in a safe and supportive environment.</p><p id="">“The beauty of this is that kids get to be kids and have fun in a safe space,” said Burroughs.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842fb237b3280b2898f7429_503473336_1242607724535644_8320311423337272003_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Seventh and eighth graders enjoyed a unique treat: access to the newly renovated Pop Lloyd Stadium, where a spirited kickball tournament brought out the best in student teamwork and athletic energy. The stadium buzzed with cheers and laughter as students ran bases, competed with pride, and supported their peers.</p><p id="">Back on school grounds, the school yard was transformed into a vibrant carnival-style playground, complete with inflatable bouncy houses, slides, popcorn, and snow cones. A variety of sports stations gave students the chance to test their skills, while music from a DJ added rhythm and energy to every corner of the event.</p><p id="">Inside the auditorium, creativity and fun took center stage. Students participated in interactive games like Paper Dragon, which challenged them to unroll ribbons using arm circles within 60 seconds, and Dizzy Mummy, where teams of two wrapped each other in toilet paper without breaking it. These games highlighted the students' creativity, agility, and sense of humor.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842fb2dd392a0f972253dee_503259866_1242607781202305_3949650415119002223_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">A standout element of this event was its cost-free experience for all participants. Thanks to student-led fundraising efforts, including book fairs and popcorn sales held throughout the school year, Fun Day was entirely funded without placing any burden on students or families.</p><p id="">“They pay for nothing, and it’s all because of their fundraising,” said Burroughs. “They did small book fairs, popcorn sales and other things. Fun Day is great because it encourages them to do well.”</p><p id="">With high energy, laughter, and unity, MLK Fun Day 2025 left lasting memories for students and staff alike. It stood as a testament to the school’s dedication to recognizing effort, fostering community, and making space for students to simply be kids.</p><p id=""><br>Photo Credit to: <strong id="">Mark Tyler, District Communications Specialist</strong></p>
