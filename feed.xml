<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City community has been lovin’ longtime Atlantic City McDonald’s owners Rita and Anthony Mack for the last four decades, and they’ve been lovin’ the community right back. And now, the City of Atlantic City has honored these two community icons with a street dedication recognizing their nearly 40 years of business excellence, community impact, and entrepreneurial leadership in the city.</p><p id="">Arctic Avenue between Michigan and Arkansas Avenues has been named <em id="">Rita and Anthony Mack Avenue</em>, paying tribute to the couple who owned and operated multiple McDonald’s franchises in Atlantic City, with their first one purchased in June 1986 and final one sold in May 2024 as they embarked on a much-deserved retirement.</p><p id="">The Macks are the definition of successful entrepreneurship in Atlantic City. Long before casinos dominated the city’s economy, there was a generation of African American business leaders who built strong, community-based enterprises that anchored neighborhoods and provided opportunity. Today, as Atlantic City’s Economic Development division under the Department of Planning and Development works to revitalize that same spirit of local ownership and empowerment, the Macks stand as living proof that businesses –especially minority-owned ones - can not only survive but thrive in Atlantic City. Rita and Anthony Mack have been the blueprint for success, showing what’s possible through hard work, generosity, and a deep commitment to community.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68fa511a331427c439d9baf0_Mack%E2%80%99s%20Street%20%20_85.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small presents the Macks with a version of their street sign to take home (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">“We really appreciate your many years of service, your selflessservice, and your dedication to the Great City of Atlantic City community," Mayor Small told the Macks during the Street Dedication Ceremony in theirhonor. It was during this ceremony that the couple also received a customstreet sign to take home, symbolizing the enduring legacy they have built.</p><p id="">Rita and Anthony Mack expressed deep gratitude for the recognition and for the community that supported them from the beginning.</p><p id="">“We are incredibly honored and humbled to receive this awesome recognition,” said Rita Mack. “The renaming of this city block to <em id="">Rita and Anthony Mack Avenue</em> is an undeniable dream for us. It’s the very block where we began our business journey in 1986, and we are thrilled beyond belief.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68fa5195b15ae74d2e622535_Mack%E2%80%99s%20Street%20%20_73.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Rita Mack speaking during the Street Dedication Ceremony in her and huer husband's honor (Credit: Edward Lea / city of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">Reflecting on their journey, Rita added:</p><p id="">“They say the most critical factors in choosing a franchise arelocation, location, location. I must say, we struck gold when we purchased ourArkansas Avenue site. But we were also blessed to find ourselves in asupportive and caring community. From the very beginning, this community hasembraced and supported us in so many ways.”</p><p id="">The Macks hope that others — especially young people and aspiringentrepreneurs — will be inspired each time they pass <em id="">Rita and Anthony MackAvenue</em>, a lasting reminder that dreams can be built right here in Atlantic City. </p><p id="">Their name now rightfully takes its place in the heart of Atlantic City in recognition of their extraordinary contributions. </p><p id="">‍</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Get ready to taste something new in Atlantic City! Starting November 1, 2025, the city will officially launch its food truck operations at two popular public destinations—Gardner’s Basin and O’Donnell Memorial Park—bringing more dining variety, energy, and opportunity to the community.</p><p id="">Approved unanimously by City Council earlier this year, this initiative reflects Atlantic City’s growing commitment to supporting small businesses and enhancing its outdoor spaces. The Office of Economic Development and Department of Planning &amp; Development have been working closely with Public Works and Licensing &amp; Inspection to prepare each site with new signage, designated vendor spaces, and clear operating guidelines to ensure a smooth launch.</p><p id="">At O’Donnell Memorial Park, food trucks will be positioned along Captain John O’Donnell Parkway, offering easy access for residents and visitors exploring the area. Meanwhile, at Gardner’s Basin, trucks will operate along the roadway between the Seawall parking lot and the Atlantic City Aquarium, providing guests with convenient and delicious options by the water.</p><p id="">Each location will accommodate up to eight registered and approved food trucks, operating daily from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Interested vendors can now apply through the City of Atlantic City website at <a target="_new" href="http://www.acnj.gov" id="">www.acnj.gov</a>. Applications open on October 6, 2025, under the Licensing &amp; Inspection section—simply select <em id="">Food Truck</em> under <em id="">Business Licenses/Mercantile</em>.</p><p id="">“This is another exciting step in showing that Atlantic City is open for business,” said Mayor Marty Small, Sr. “We’re creating opportunities for small businesses, generating tax revenue, and giving residents and visitors more affordable food options in two of our most visited public areas.”</p><p id="">Bruce Weekes, Assistant Director of Economic Development, added, “Residents have asked for this for years—and we listened. Our goal is for this program to serve as a stepping stone for food operators to establish themselves right here in Atlantic City, grow their brands, and eventually open permanent storefronts.”</p><p id="">All participating food trucks will be inspected and approved by the City of Atlantic City Health Department and the Atlantic City Fire Department before operation. Vendors will be responsible for maintaining cleanliness and following all city regulations. Please note that the sale of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis is strictly prohibited.</p><p id="">With this new initiative, Atlantic City continues to prove that it’s not just a destination—it’s a community of opportunity, where entrepreneurs can thrive and residents can enjoy diverse, local experiences every day.</p>

What began as an internal newsletter has grown into a dynamic publication that celebrates everything that makes Atlantic City an extraordinary place to live, work, and thrive.</p><p id="">The rebrand comes at an exciting time, aligning with the launch of the Great Day Atlantic City app—a digital platform designed to shine a light on the people, progress, and positive news happening across the city. Together, the Gazette and the app form a powerful communication hub, keeping residents, employees, and visitors informed about all the great things taking place within Atlantic City.</p><p id="">In his opening message, Mayor Marty Small Sr. expressed enthusiasm for the Gazette’s evolution and the city’s renewed focus on positivity and transparency. “There are way too many negative voices out there when it comes to the Great City of Atlantic City,” the Mayor said. “The Great Day platform gives all the positives, which far outweigh the negatives—the spotlight they deserve.”</p><p id="">This month’s issue of the Great Day Gazette is packed with inspiring stories, community highlights, and exciting updates. Readers can look back on the success of <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com/news/positive-culture-shift-for-atlantic-city-employees-continues-with-mayor-smalls-great-day-event" id=""><strong id="">Great Day 2025</strong></a>, a day of motivation and team building for city employees dedicated to the memory of Chief of Staff Ernest Coursey. The event featured keynote speaker Nehemiah Davis, who encouraged city staff to focus on growth, resilience, and becoming the best versions of themselves.</p><p id="">The Gazette also covers the city’s presence at the first Atlantic City Strategic Communications Summit, hosted by Stockton University and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA). There, the city’s Marketing Team—including Public Information Officer Andrew Kramer, Assistant PIO Adele Polk, Shennita Williams, and Ziggy Chau of Lucky PR—presented Great Day Atlantic City as a leading example of civic storytelling and community engagement. The summit emphasized collaboration and shared messaging across local institutions to build a stronger, unified voice for Atlantic City.</p><p id="">Readers will also find updates on major development and infrastructure projects. Mayor Small joined community leaders for the grand opening of The Seahaus Hotel and Cucina Del Mar, celebrating the continued growth of Atlantic City’s hospitality sector. Meanwhile, the city began the long-anticipated revitalization of Atlantic Avenue—a transformative project that includes new paving, traffic signal upgrades, ADA-compliant ramps, enhanced lighting, and beautification improvements designed to make the corridor safer and more welcoming for all.</p><p id="">Economic opportunity and small business growth are also front and center. The Gazette highlights the Small Business Micro Grant Program, providing reimbursement support for local businesses through federal ARPA funding, and the new food truck program opening two prime locations—Gardner’s Basin and O’Donnell Memorial Park—to bring affordable dining options and entrepreneurial opportunities to the community.</p><p id="">In Public Safety News, the friendly rivalry between the Atlantic City Fire Department and Police Department took center stage during the first-ever Mayor’s Cup Softball Game. The community gathered at Pop Lloyd Stadium to cheer on both teams, celebrating camaraderie and civic pride. The issue also recognized newly promoted fire officers and honored the city’s first responders during the Atlantic City 9/11 Memorial Ceremony.</p><p id="">The Gazette continued its tradition of celebrating people and programs that make Atlantic City vibrant—from Senior Appreciation Day and Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations at City Hall, to new youth initiatives including the Youth Theater Program, Girl Scouts sessions, and Little Leapers gymnastics. Each story reflected the city’s ongoing mission to create inclusive, engaging opportunities for all residents—young and old alike.</p><p id="">Looking ahead, the issue also shared details on upcoming events that embody the city’s community spirit, including the Flood Safety Workshop, the Roll Out! Skating Party for National Coming Out Day, the Drive-In Movie &amp; S’mores Night at Bader Field, and the much-anticipated Harvest Town Festival at Gardner’s Basin.</p><p id="">As the city continues to evolve, the Great Day Gazette stands as a symbol of connection and collaboration—highlighting the stories that too often go untold and celebrating the everyday efforts that make Atlantic City stronger. Whether it’s infrastructure progress, employee recognition, or community celebration, the Gazette captures it all.</p><p id="">Mayor Small summed it up best: “No other administration in Atlantic City history has given employees the amount of training, recognition, and opportunity they’re getting right now—and that’s something I’ll never let up on.”</p><p id="">Read the full October 2025 issue of the Great Day Gazette to stay informed, inspired, and connected to the city’s latest achievements and upcoming events. Because here in Atlantic City—every day truly is a Great Day.</p><p id="">‍</p><h5 id=""><strong id="">To view the full version of October 2025 Great Day Gazette, click here:</strong> <a href="https://www.acnj.gov/_Content/pdf/Great-Day-Gazette-October-2025.pdf">View the newsletter</a>‍</h5>

Just as importantly, he has invested heavily in training programs that give staff unprecedented professional development and the skills needed to better serve Atlantic City taxpayers.</p><p id="">That commitment came into full focus at this year’s <strong id="">Great Day 2025</strong> event held at the Showboat Resort for a third straight year. This is the mayor’s signature initiative to strengthen workforce climate and culture, boost morale, and unite City of Atlantic City employees as one team. It’s the only time each year every city worker gathers under one roof outside city buildings to receive key organizational updates directly from the mayor and gain fresh perspective from nationally recognized outside sources.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab55fbfa7c8670733811c_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_160.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Mayor Small and guest speaker Nehemiah Davis during Great Day 2025 at Showboat Resort (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">This year’s motivational speaker was philanthropist Nehemiah Davis, who shared his inspiring journey from humble beginnings in Philadelphia—where he frequently found himself getting into trouble—to becoming a prominent figure dedicated to helping others transform their lives. Addressing City of Atlantic City employees, Davis encouraged them to write down the affirmation: “I’m committed and focused on making this the best year ever.” He emphasized how mindset shifts can lead to real change and challenged staff to stop saying, “I have to go to work,” and instead embrace the privilege of being able to say, “I get to go to work”— especially in a place like Atlantic City.</p><p id="">Great Day 2025 carried added significance this year, as it was held in memory of the late Chief of Staff Ernest Coursey. Known for his unwavering dedication as a public servant and his deep care for city employees, Coursey left a lasting legacy. In his honor, all staff wore commemorative shirts, and the city announced the upcoming launch of the Coursey Cares Health&amp; Wellness Challenge, an initiative aimed at promoting small, sustainable lifestyle changes that employees can carry with them for life.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:4817px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="4817px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab5d59d961afd2648ce17_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_15.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">The City of Atlantic City Health &amp; Human Serivces Department, CDBG Office and Public Information Office share details of the Coursey Cares Challenge during Great Day 2025 (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure><p id="">Following the professional development portion of the day, employees get to relax and connect at Showboat’s Island Waterpark, and this year was no exception. With more than 700 employees spread across City Hall, the Public Safety Building, the Public Works Yard, and other locations, some staff members rarely cross paths, if ever. But on this one day a year, in the open, informal setting of the waterpark, colleagues can interact, bond, and build stronger relationships. Team building is a cornerstone of the Small Administration. It’s why each department is tasked with organizing its own annual retreat outside the Great Day event, and why Mayor Small personally leads a retreat for his directors. </p><p id="">A recent article from <em id="">The Press of Atlantic City</em> covering Great Day 2025 failed to spotlight the most critical component of the event, which is Mayor Small’s mission to raise expectations, invest in employee development, and celebrate the city's workforce. Mayor Small is demonstrating that a city government can evolve from within—and Great Day 2025 is a shining example of that transformation. His message is clear: when the workforce is motivated, well-trained, and connected, the entire Atlantic City community reaps the rewards.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68dab6a89f3e7cc7d1e0d652_Staff%20Great%20Day%20_96.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">City staff getting to unwind at Island Waterpark at the conclusion of Great Day 2025 (Credit: Edward Lea / City of Atlantic City)</figcaption></figure>

]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In <strong id="">Atlantic City</strong>, progress is not just measured in buildings or investments — it is reflected in the success of the small businesses that form the city’s backbone. Through its Keep It Local campaign, led by the Economic Development division under the Planning &amp; Development Department, the City of Atlantic City recognized the vital role that local entrepreneurs play in shaping the community’s future.</p><p id="">One highlight of this effort was the presentation of the Economic Growth &amp; Development Award to Kelsey’s Atlantic City, a local restaurant that has become a cultural landmark. For years, owners Kelsey and Kimberly Jackson worked tirelessly to serve not only food, but also hospitality that felt like home.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1790px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1790px"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da883d99c301bd857fd2cb_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20212304.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">From its very beginning,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/kelseysatlanticcity" id=""> <strong id="">Kelsey’s</strong></a> was more than a place to eat. It was a gathering space where neighbors could share southern comfort meals, enjoy live music, and feel connected. It showed how a business could grow into a community institution, weaving itself into the everyday life of Atlantic City.</p><p id="">With three locations across the city, Kelsey’s also became a driver of local economic activity. By welcoming both residents and visitors, it drew people into neighborhoods, fueled local spending, and created job opportunities. In doing so, it embodied the spirit of growth and resilience that defines Atlantic City.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1350px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1350px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da86d77a2c0bf32080aaa1_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20211530.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The recognition of Kelsey’s demonstrated how local businesses reflect the larger momentum happening in the city. As Atlantic City invested in its neighborhoods, public spaces, and small enterprises, the success stories of people like the Jackson family became proof that the city’s vision of renewal was not only possible but already taking shape.</p><p id="">Receiving the award was described by Kelsey Jackson as “an honor and a privilege.” He emphasized that the acknowledgment was a testament to the dedication and effort put into the business over the years. Kimberly Jackson added that Atlantic City itself was “doing better than ever,” reflecting the citywide growth happening all around them.</p><p id="">Stories like Kelsey’s show why Atlantic City is more than a place to visit — it is a city to believe in. It is a place where hard work is recognized, where local culture thrives, and where economic development goes hand in hand with community spirit.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1426px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1426px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68da86eff6932921eb1f8a71_Screenshot%202025-09-29%20211508.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">This recognition stood as a reminder that Atlantic City is not only a destination for entertainment but also a community where people can put down roots, build businesses, and create lasting impact. It is a city where individuals can find opportunity, connection, and pride.</p><p id="">Every award, every campaign, and every small business success adds to a bigger story — a story of a city moving forward together. Atlantic City is not just about what it offers to visitors; it is about what it provides to its own residents: a place to live, to work, and to grow.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">When Sophia Mammucari tells young people in Atlantic City, <em id="">“This city doesn’t limit you,”</em> she’s not just offering encouragement—she’s living proof of what’s possible.</p><p id="">Now a sophomore at Harvard University, Mammucari’s journey began in the heart of Atlantic City. Despite moving frequently during her early years, her family ultimately made Atlantic City home. It was there, as a student at Atlantic City High School, that she began to dream big and build the foundation that would carry her all the way to the Ivy League.</p><p id="">“Getting into Harvard was the best day of my life,” she said.</p><p id="">Mammucari is not only thriving academically, but she’s also giving back to the city that raised her. This summer, she returned home to intern with the City of Atlantic City Mayor’s Office and Business Administration Office, where she gained firsthand experience in how municipal government functions.</p><p id="">“I just wanted to learn how government works,” she explained. “I saw the full process, and it was full circle. My journey ended with the City Council meeting, so I saw how ordinances were written, how issues were addressed, all of the meetings that go into it, all the planning, and how there isn’t always a simple answer to everything. The Business Administrator (Anthony Swan) and Mayor (Small) really do work to address all concerns that come to City Hall.”</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:5472px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="5472px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68c826f2c143c131d2eb8f3e_Sophia%20Storm.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">As part of her summer internship with the City of Atlantic City, Sophia Mammucari got to take part in one of Mayor Small's news conferences. </figcaption></figure><p id="">Through programs like CitiStat, which allows residents to report and track issues through data-driven governance, Mammucari got to see how committed the city is to its own revitalization.</p><p id="">“I was impressed by how much work is being done to improve Atlantic City and to create a real renaissance,” she added.</p><p id="">Mammucari’s connection to the Small administration runs deeper than her internship. She is also a previous recipient of the <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com/department-stories/from-dream-to-degree-atlantic-citys-3m-scholarship-fund-is-changing-lives" id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship</a>, three-year, $3 million initiative supporting Atlantic City students in their pursuit of higher education.</p><p id="">“The scholarships helped me with my expenses during college and made it possible to go to Harvard and excel there,” she said.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:3791px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="3791px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68c82812c8908ded144f07dc_96-AC%20Scholarship%202024%20637.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Sophia Mammucari is a former 'Mayor Marty Small, Sr. Scholarship' recipient.</figcaption></figure><p id="">While she’s currently making her mark in Boston, Mammucari hasn’t forgotten where she came from. She hopes to one day return to Atlantic City and introduce her organization, <a href="https://www.thehigheredvantage.org/" target="_blank" id=""><strong id=""><em id="">The Higher EDvantage</em></strong></a>, to local students. The nonprofit offers guidance and support for those pursuing college or another form of higher education.</p><p id="">And her ambitions don’t stop there. Could “Mayor Mammucari” be in the city’s future?</p><p id="">“I don’t want to take Mayor Small’s job,” she said with a smile. “But maybe when he retires, I’d love to run for a government position.”</p><p id="">For now, Mammucari remains focused on her education—and on serving as a role model for the next generation of Atlantic City youth.</p><p id="">“I hope I can be someone local students look up to,” she said. “I always encourage kids—especially those from low-income backgrounds or who go to Atlantic City High School—to dream big. You may not think you’re capable, but the answer is always going to be no if you don’t try.”</p><p id="">If anyone ever doubts her hometown or says something negative about it, Mammucari is ready to set the record straight! And she now has the inside experience to back her stance and looks forward to sharing with the world why she is proud to be from Atlantic City and just how much potential this city truly has.</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">PHOTOS BY <strong id="">EDWARD LEA / CITY OF ATLANTIC CITY</strong></p>

<p id=""><strong id="">Celebrating Business Excellence in Atlantic City</strong></p><p id="">In Atlantic City, summer isn’t only about the boardwalk, beaches, and entertainment — it’s also a season to celebrate community pride and local achievement.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Hundreds of residents, families, and first responders gathered this morning at the Saracini-O’Neill 9/11 Memorial on Jackson Avenue and the Boardwalk for an hour-and-a-half ceremony honoring the nearly 3,000 lives lost in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p><p id="">Standing together in solidarity, the Atlantic City Police Department (ACPD) and Atlantic City Fire Department (ACFD) joined city and county officials, Mayor Marty Small Sr., members of the Ventnor Police and Fire Departments, and the Egg Harbor Township Fire Department.

Music from the Sandpipers Pipes &amp; Drums of Atlantic County added to the solemn atmosphere, while an Honor Guard of ACPD and ACFD members presented the colors.</p><p id="">Among those honored were Angel and Camille Morales, retired NYPD officers who responded to Ground Zero on September 11 and now live in Atlantic City. Their presence underscored the continuing connection between the city and the heroism displayed 24 years ago.</p><p id="">Mayor Small addressed the crowd, reflecting on resilience, healing, and the importance of remembrance.

This milestone underscored the significance of ACPD’s role in ensuring justice and safeguarding vulnerable victims.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1914px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1914px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68c2e33018c6f1bcfba53836_545604368_1195228735968924_3611551527393442104_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The Operations 803 Award was created to honor officers who display initiative, resilience, and leadership that inspires others to uphold the highest standards of service. The award was named in honor of Officer Josh Lee Vadell, whose courage in the face of life-altering injuries continued to inspire the ACPD family and community.</p><p id="">Among the recipients were Detectives Leah McHale, Adrianna Petinga, and Mitzi Cruz, along with Officers Juan Garcia, Julian Monsalve, James Eckert, Brandon Bower, Dylan Imbrenda, John Bell, Robert Thompson, and Andrew Xiques. Their actions reflected extraordinary dedication to duty and unwavering commitment to protecting the community.</p><p id="">The recognition also highlighted ACPD’s strong collaboration with partner agencies, reinforcing the importance of interdepartmental coordination in addressing crimes that span beyond city borders. The case served as a powerful example of what law enforcement could achieve when working together.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr. and community leaders expressed gratitude to the officers for their bravery and professionalism. The acknowledgment of their work demonstrated Atlantic City’s commitment to both public safety and the pursuit of justice.</p><p id="">The award ceremony served not only as recognition but also as a reminder of the risks law enforcement officers take daily to protect their communities. The officers’ resilience and courage set a benchmark for others within the ACPD.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In Atlantic City, community is more than just a word — it’s a way of life. Through the Keep It Local campaign, led by the City of Atlantic City’s Economic Development division under the Planning &amp; Development Department, small businesses were celebrated for the essential role they played in shaping the city’s identity and strengthening its neighborhoods.</p><p id="">At the heart of this recognition stood a true local treasure: The Irish Pub Atlantic City, recipient of the Community Spirit Award.</p><p id="">A Legacy of Hospitality<br>With roots dating back to the 19th century, Richard and Cathy Burke founded The Irish Pub in 1972. Since then, it grew into more than just a dining spot. It became a local landmark, a piece of living history, and a gathering place where generations of residents and visitors alike came together for food, conversation, and friendship. From corned beef sandwiches to pints of beer, every visit carried with it the warmth of a second home.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1208px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1208px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68bb106e93caaa139a96f4e6_Screenshot%202025-09-06%20001641.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">The Irish Pub Owner - Cathy Burke</figcaption></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Standing the Test of Time</strong><br>Through decades of change, The Irish Pub remained a steady presence, a cornerstone that reflected the resilience and hospitality of Atlantic City itself. Tourists may have come for the boardwalk, beaches, or casinos, but locals knew there was always a seat waiting for them at the pub — a place to feel welcome and connected.</p><p id=""><strong id="">A Community Rooted in Pride</strong><br>For Cathy Burke, the recognition was deeply meaningful. “We are such a supportive community of each other,” she shared. “It’s wonderful when you can have a community you love, you support and you’re appreciative to be in a city as beautiful as Atlantic City.”</p><p id="">Her words reflected not just the spirit of The Irish Pub, but the broader truth about why Atlantic City continues to be a city in motion: its strength lies in its people and their dedication to each other.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1841px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1841px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68bb10b3e0e16ed942145343_Screenshot%202025-09-06%20003206.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Why Atlantic City?</strong><br>Moments like these highlight why Atlantic City is more than a destination, it is a great community to live, to work, and to thrive. From local businesses that anchor neighborhoods, to city-led initiatives that honor and uplift them, Atlantic City is writing a story where tradition and progress go hand in hand.</p><p id=""><strong>Looking Ahead<br></strong>The Community Spirit Award was not just about honoring one business. It was about recognizing what makes Atlantic City special: its resilience, its pride, and its commitment to supporting local voices that carry the city’s culture forward.</p><p id="">As Atlantic City continues to grow and evolve, it is places like The Irish Pub — and the countless small businesses like it — that remind everyone why community matters, and why Atlantic City remains a city where opportunity, history, and heart all come together.</p>

<p id=""><strong id="">A Celebration of Resilience in Atlantic City</strong></p><p id="">In Atlantic City, resilience isn’t just a quality, it’s a way of life.

More than storefronts, these businesses represent history, tradition, and the enduring spirit of a city that thrives through connection.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Honoring Generations of Service</strong><br>At the heart of this recognition stood <strong id="">Barbera Seafood Market</strong>, recipient of the <strong id="">Resiliency Award</strong>.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City made history with the launch of its first-ever <strong id="">Black Business Expo</strong>, a dynamic celebration of entrepreneurship and community collaboration. Held at the historic All Wars Memorial Building on August 26, 2025, the expo brought together Black-owned business vendors, local officials, and residents in honor of <strong id=""><em id="">National Black Business Month</em></strong>. The event served as a platform for local entrepreneurs to showcase their goods and services, gain exposure, and access vital resources designed to help their businesses grow.</p><p id="">Among the enthusiastic vendors was Ruschele Whitfield, owner of <em id="">Fitness Foodies</em>, a health-focused brand that promotes wellness through nutritious snacks and products.</p><p id="">“I’m grateful that the city arranged such a meaningful event for all entrepreneurs, especially Black entrepreneurs,” Whitfield said. “Small business ownership is not easy. So when you have a chance to elevate your business, you need community and motivation. We’re all excited to buy, sell, and learn here.”</p><p id="">The expo featured panel discussions with both emerging and established business leaders, live radiobroadcasts promoting local brands, and a curated art exhibit led by Atlantic City historian Ralph Hunter. In addition, attendees had the opportunity to apply for micro-grants aimed at supporting business development.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width=""><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68af6501709841fdaf511f0b_Black%20Expo_7.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Attendees getting to shop around and support Black businesses set up as vendors</figcaption></figure><p id="">For vendors like Samantha Prescott, founder of <em id="">Nana’s Pudding</em>, the experience was about more than just sales.</p><p id="">“This is a great marketing and networking event,” Prescott said. “The room is full of information and resources. It was great to be a part of it!”</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small Sr. addressed the hundreds of attendees, highlighting the importance of Black-owned businesses to the city’s economic future. He pointed out how previous administrations had long overlooked this part of the community—but that changed under the Small administration.</p><p id="">“There was a time when our city was home to hundreds of Black-owned businesses,” added Bruce Weekes,<strong id=""> </strong>the City of Atlantic City’s Assistant Director of Economic Development and co-organizer of the expo. “Today, that number has dwindled to just dozens. We see this expo as a launching pad to help restore the strong presence Black businesses once had in our community.”</p><p>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68af66d6f5c84cdfc2c83b81_Black%20Expo_17.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">Bruce Weekes welcoming attendees to the Atlantic City Black Business Expo</figcaption></figure><p id="">The expo was organized by the city’s Economic Development team, led by Weekes and Pam Fields, in collaboration with the Planning &amp; Development Department and with strong support from Mayor Small, who made several major announcements during the event:</p><ul id=""> <li id=""><strong id="">A $500,000 commitment in grant funding to support Black-owned businesses in Atlantic City.</strong></li> <li id=""><strong id="">The launch of "Great Day &nbsp;University" this fall, a free financial wellness program for &nbsp;residents offering credit repair and financial planning.</strong></li> <li id=""><strong id="">A promise to bring the Black Business Expo back next year, making it an annual tradition.</strong></li></ul><p id="">The event also marked the release of the Atlantic City Black Business Directory, a new resource thatlists Black-owned businesses across the city by category, complete with contactinformation - a tool designed to promote visibility and encourage localsupport.

<h4 id=""><em id="">"Marketing is not always about money, it’s about momentum."</em></h4><p id="">That is just one of the many criticallessons presented to a room full of local entrepreneurs during a free marketing seminar offered by the City of Atlantic City Economic Development division of the Planning &amp; Development department.</p><p id="">“Coffee and Conversation: Marketing Without Any Money” drew a full crowd at Beat the Grind Café—a fitting location, as the small business itself has benefited from some of the same guidance now being shared.

<p id="">As storm conditions continue to affect the Jersey Shore, Mayor Marty Small Sr. joined The Weather Channel’s Reynolds Wolfe to discuss Atlantic City’s readiness, the challenges of flooding, and the city’s commitment to keeping residents and visitors safe.</p><h3 id="">A City Prepared for the Storm</h3><p id="">Despite the threat of strong winds, high surf, and coastal flooding, Mayor Small opened the interview with confidence: <em id="">“Despite the storm, it’s a great day here in the City of Atlantic City. My administration is prepared from the beach patrol to emergency management, to police, to fire, to public works. We’ve got a little bit of experience in this.”</em></p><p id="">The Mayor pointed to several flood-prone neighborhoods of particular concern, including Bungalow Park, Venice Park, Chelsea Heights, and Fairmount Avenue, where moderate flooding was expected around 7:42 PM high tide. While the city projected water levels of 7.6 feet—well below the 10.9 feet recorded during Hurricane Sandy—officials emphasized caution.</p><h3 id="">A Call for Safety</h3><p id="">Mayor Small highlighted both residents and tourists in his message: <em id="">“This is an international destination, the great city of Atlantic City. And as mayor, I’m responsible for the health, welfare, and safety of the residents and the tourists. It’s heed to our warnings. It is very dangerous.”</em></p><p id="">With powerful waves attracting onlookers and surfers, city officials urged the public to avoid risky behavior and remain cautious. Sustained winds of <strong id="">45 mph with gusts up to 55 mph</strong> were expected overnight, compounding the risk of coastal flooding and rip currents.</p><h3 id="">Concerns Over Beaches</h3><p id="">One of the Mayor’s biggest concerns was the potential loss of beaches on the north end of Atlantic City, home to major resorts including Hard Rock, Ocean, Resorts, and Showboat. The Army Corps of Engineers had recently completed a replenishment project, but storm erosion threatened to undo much of the progress. <em id="">“We’re just hoping to salvage some of the beach for the last two weekends of the summer,”</em> the Mayor said, noting that further discussions with federal partners may be needed once the storm passes.</p><h3 id="">A Long Season Ahead</h3><p id="">Asked how the city stays prepared during a long Atlantic hurricane season, Mayor Small compared the challenge to football, proudly invoking his hometown team: <em id="">“It’s just like my football team, the world champion Philadelphia Eagles, which is going to win it again. We’re prepared here—be it events like this, blizzards, nor’easters, and more. We’ve got the professional team to execute and weather the storm.”</em></p><h3 id="">Looking Forward</h3><p id="">While conditions were expected to improve with clearer skies over the weekend, rip currents and flooding risks remain top concerns. Mayor Small reassured the public that Atlantic City has the infrastructure, the experience, and the dedication to respond to whatever Mother Nature brings.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City has long been known for its casinos, boardwalk, and bustling entertainment scene—but one small business has been changing that narrative with bold flavors and culinary innovation. This year, Tony Boloney’s Atlantic City and its spinoff, Mad Mutz Laboratory, were awarded the Innovation Award as part of the City of Atlantic City’s <em id="">“Keep It Local”</em> campaign.</p><p id="">The award was presented by the city’s <strong id="">Economic Development Division</strong> under the Department of Planning &amp; Development, highlighting the critical role that small businesses play in shaping Atlantic City’s identity and strengthening its local economy.</p><h3 id="">From a Convenience Store to a Culinary Institution</h3><p id="">When founder Mike Hauke opened Tony Boloney’s in 2009, the business began as a modest convenience store. But it wasn’t long before Hauke shifted gears, transforming the space into a restaurant that pushed boundaries with imaginative pizzas, sandwiches, and mozzarella creations.</p><p id="">Known for its playful, over-the-top menu, Tony Boloney’s quickly became a destination for food lovers. One of its biggest hits—the flavored mozzarella sticks—was not only a fan favorite but also the spark that inspired Hauke to launch Mad Mutz Laboratory, a dedicated brand built around producing these mozzarella sticks on a larger scale.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1678px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1678px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a8b272ea2daec5515eaf1b_Screenshot%202025-08-23%20015250.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Mad Mutz Laboratory: From Atlantic City to Global Stage</h3><p id="">With the creation of Mad Mutz Laboratory, Hauke and his business partner Michael Burns took a local favorite and elevated it into a product with national and international appeal. Their inventive mozzarella sticks even landed them on ABC’s <em id="">Shark Tank</em>, a milestone that further propelled the brand’s recognition and reach.</p><p id="">What began as a neighborhood eatery has now grown into a globally recognized food brand, demonstrating how a mix of creativity, risk-taking, and dedication can fuel long-term growth and success.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1829px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1829px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68a8b282f8f259b3aa01bf1d_Screenshot%202025-08-23%20015303.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Recognized for Innovation</h3><p id="">At the award ceremony, Mayor Marty Small Sr. personally honored Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory, issuing a proclamation that praised the businesses as role models for future entrepreneurs.</p><p id="">“Therefore, I, Mayor Marty Small Sr., Mayor of the great city of Atlantic City, hereby recognize Mad Mutz’s Mozzarella Laboratory for being a role model for future entrepreneurs in the great city of Atlantic City and wish this business continued success both locally and now globally.”</p><p id="">For Hauke, the recognition was deeply meaningful. He described it as “a welcoming surprise” to be honored by the city and proud to see both his and Michael Burns’ work celebrated with the Innovation Award.</p><h3 id="">A Community Built on Creativity</h3><p id="">The story of Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory reflects more than just the rise of a successful business. It highlights the power of innovation in Atlantic City’s small business community and how creative entrepreneurs can help redefine the city’s culture and reputation.</p><p id="">The “Keep It Local” campaign is designed to showcase businesses like Hauke’s that bring something fresh and unexpected to the community, proving that Atlantic City is about more than its casinos—it’s also about flavor, passion, and originality.</p><h3 id="">Looking Ahead</h3><p id="">With a strong foundation built on innovation, national recognition, and global reach, Tony Boloney’s and Mad Mutz Laboratory continue to set the bar for what’s possible when big ideas meet local pride. For Hauke and his team, the journey from a convenience store in 2009 to winning an <strong id="">Innovation Award in 2025</strong> is proof that Atlantic City’s entrepreneurial spirit is alive and thriving.</p><p id="">‍</p><h4 id=""><strong id="">#InvestinAC #LiveInAC #WorkInAC</strong></h4>
