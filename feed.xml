<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Atlantic City’s <strong id="">Clean Communities Initiative</strong> officially wrapped its fourth consecutive summer of promoting neighborhood pride and environmental stewardship. Led by the <strong id="">Department of Public Works</strong>, the program returned in 2025 and once again provided local residents with the opportunity to <strong id="">earn money</strong> while actively improving their own communities.</p><p id="">Throughout the summer, the Public Works Department rotated through different Atlantic City wards daily, conducting neighborhood cleanups and inviting the public to join the effort. This hands-on program was designed to inspire civic responsibility and a cleaner, safer Atlantic City for all. Residents responded with enthusiasm and a shared commitment to the cause.</p><p id="">Groups of five or more were invited to participate by committing to clean at least four blocks twice a month. In return, these groups received a <strong id="">$200 monthly stipend</strong>, making the initiative a win-win: residents benefited financially while the city saw a significant reduction in litter and debris. Participants were provided with <strong id="">trash bags</strong>, <strong id="">gloves</strong>, <strong id="">grabbers</strong>, and <strong id="">safety vests</strong> to ensure an efficient and safe cleanup process.</p><p id="">The program also emphasized accessibility. Interested residents were able to collect applications at the <strong id="">Public Works Office in Room 604 at City Hall</strong>, where they also received further instructions. All inquiries during the program period were directed to <strong id="">Clean Communities Coordinator Angela Pittman</strong>.</p><p id="">The 2025 initiative officially ran through <strong id="">October 1, 2025</strong>, giving residents a full summer to take part. The city’s website, <a target="_new" href="http://www.acnj.gov" id=""><strong id="">www.acnj.gov</strong></a>, hosted the initial daily cleanup schedule and other updates throughout the season, allowing participants to stay informed and engaged.</p><p id="">Beyond the monetary incentive, many participants cited a sense of pride and ownership in their neighborhoods as the most rewarding aspect. The program succeeded in not only cleaning the streets but also in strengthening bonds between neighbors and fostering a collective sense of responsibility.</p><p id="">This summer’s Clean Communities program also served as a platform for youth engagement. Several local youth groups and student organizations joined in, turning their summer break into a meaningful community service experience.</p><p id="">City officials expressed satisfaction with the turnout and effectiveness of the program. They noted that litter levels were visibly reduced and public response was overwhelmingly positive, setting the stage for continued growth of the initiative in future years.</p><p id="">The 2025 program demonstrated that with a shared goal and a small incentive, community transformation is achievable. Atlantic City residents once again showed that they are ready and willing to step up for the betterment of their neighborhoods.</p><p>‍</p>

<p id="">On June 5, 2025, the City of Atlantic City, in partnership with the State of New Jersey, proudly celebrated the grand opening of the Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver Plaza. Located outside City Hall, this new space was named in honor of the late Lieutenant Governor, a trailblazer who left a lasting mark on New Jersey’s political and civic landscape.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr. led the ribbon-cutting ceremony alongside New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Commissioner Jaquelyn Suarez, members of Sheila Oliver’s family, and a gathering of City, County, and State officials. The event marked both a celebration of legacy and the completion of a major public space renovation.</p><p id="">This project not only paid tribute to Lt. Governor Sheila Oliver but also significantly improved the public’s experience at City Hall. The main entrance, closed since construction began in spring 2024, was reopened with a covered walkway and a new security gate, enhancing both convenience and safety.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/68430170415f895084493a57_504188450_1024861109828358_8295916882888555672_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">Further security upgrades included improved lighting across the courtyard, with lanterns added to the exterior walls, and reconfigured main and employee entrance doors to streamline access and safety. Sheila Oliver’s name, now prominently etched above the entrance walkway, along with her image and signage throughout the plaza, added a powerful visual tribute.</p><p id="">The plaza also received extensive aesthetic improvements. Visitors can now enjoy built-in benches, a thoughtfully designed rain garden, an elegant marble fountain, and a pergola that brings charm and shade to the space. Lush new trees, shrubs, and grass were planted to soften the urban setting and create a welcoming environment.</p><p id="">The building itself received attention as well. Existing exterior walls were power washed and repainted, restoring their original brightness and contributing to the refreshed look and feel of the City Hall complex.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6843018d8174a929c167fb94_504183632_1024861116495024_5997697757120594477_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">To make the plaza more walkable, pedestrian space was expanded across the courtyard. These wider walking paths made the area more accessible and navigable for visitors, staff, and residents passing through the site.</p><p id="">In addition to the courtyard renovations, the City Hall parking lot was repaved and redesigned. A new parking attendant booth was installed at the South Carolina Avenue entrance, further improving visitor management and traffic flow.</p><p id="">Lastly, in line with the city’s growing commitment to renewable energy, six Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations were scheduled to be installed later in the month—adding a forward-thinking, sustainable element to the site.</p><p id="">The opening of the Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver Plaza marked more than the completion of a construction project—it symbolized respect for a remarkable leader and a renewed vision for civic space in Atlantic City. The plaza now stands as a lasting reminder of her legacy and the city’s dedication to accessibility, safety, and sustainability.</p><p id="">‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Photo Credits to: <strong>Ed Lea / City of Atlantic City</strong></p>

<p id="">The 12th Annual Boat Races at Atlantic City High School were a resounding success, drawing cheers from classmates, teachers, and visitors as students put their engineering and physics knowledge to the test on the water.</p><p id="">Held on campus in Atlantic City, NJ, this year’s event celebrated creativity, teamwork, and scientific application through one of the school’s most exciting traditions. Students from Honors Physics and AP Physics 1 classes participated, using principles they learned throughout the year to design and race their boats across a makeshift course.</p><p id="">The competition was not only about speed, but also about design, buoyancy, and innovation. Every team had the opportunity to present their vessels, explain their engineering choices, and demonstrate how physics could be applied in a practical, hands-on challenge.</p><p id="">The highlight of the event came when a new school record was set by Zuzanna Turska ’25, a two-time champion, and her teammates. Their boat sped across the finish line faster than any in previous years, cementing their names in the school’s physics legacy. Their victory proved to be a perfect blend of technical skill and effective collaboration.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842ffa1d843c8bd4da564c2_503858217_18228357895293165_3238898973631612657_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">The first-place prize went to “Puff Mobile”, created by students in the Honors Physics class. Known for its sleek design and aerodynamic efficiency, the boat outpaced its competitors while remaining remarkably stable during the race.</p><p id="">Second and third place were awarded to “Armstrong” and “Mayflower”, both entries from AP Physics 1. These boats demonstrated unique structural solutions and a deep understanding of force, motion, and fluid dynamics.</p><p id="">The event was as educational as it was entertaining, giving students the chance to engage with physics in a way that was both interactive and memorable. Teachers and spectators alike were impressed by the ingenuity on display and the energy students brought to the challenge.</p><p id="">The race also served as an opportunity for students to practice problem-solving, collaboration, and communication, all key components of STEM education. Whether their boats placed or not, every participant walked away with valuable experience and a sense of pride.</p><p id="">A big thank you went out to all who came to support the event, especially the teachers who organized it and the students who made it possible. The 12th Annual Boat Races stood as a testament to what students can achieve when given the space to explore, build, and compete.</p><p>‍</p><p id="">Photo Credit to: <strong>Atlantic City High School</strong></p>

<description><![CDATA[Students at Pennsylvania Avenue School impressed audiences with their lively and heartfelt performance of "101 Dalmatians Kids", the final show of the school year. The production celebrated creativity, courage, and the transformative power of the performing arts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Pennsylvania Avenue School’s Visual Performing Arts students took center stage in a delightful presentation of "101 Dalmatians Kids", earning praise for their talent, dedication, and teamwork. Performed in early June 2025, the show was a highlight of the school year and a celebration of the power of the arts in education.</p><p id="">The production showcased the strength of the school’s thriving arts program, led by passionate educators and committed young performers. Dr. Nycole Lyles-Belton, a key organizer, shared how proud the staff was of the students' work ethic and growth throughout the process. “They worked hard, and we’re proud of them,” she said. “It was great to see the students take responsibility, take their books home, learn their parts and learn the songs.”</p><p id="">Preparation for the performance spanned weeks, with students rehearsing after school and on Saturdays. Their dedication, guided by their teachers, helped them master both lines and songs. The students put their hearts into the project, overcoming stage fright and stepping into their roles with courage and enthusiasm.</p><p id="">“They put their hearts into it,” Lyles-Belton noted. “To be able to perform on a stage in front of people is nerve-wracking—it’s nerve-wracking for adults. So, to see the students get up and do this with courage, I’m very pleased.” The rehearsal process also fostered teamwork, a sense of community, and deepened each student’s confidence.</p><p id="">The students performed the play three times. The first show welcomed parents, offering a more intimate environment where families could watch their children shine. Family members like Mecca Faulkner, Medinah Law, Billie Shannon, and Yah’Cirah Morgan came out to support Jonirah and Johnny Morgan, who played leading roles. The audience was thrilled by the students’ ability to deliver lines and capture the spirit of the story. “It was wonderful,” said Faulkner. “It was energetic and well put together,” added Law.</p><p id="">The next two performances were opened to the school community, allowing teachers, students, and staff to experience the production. These showings helped transform the school into a hub of culture and creative energy, showcasing the impact of the arts on school spirit and student expression.</p><p id="">The production of "101 Dalmatians Kids", based on the classic Disney tale, came to life through the students’ playful energy and commitment. Their interpretation of the brave Dalmatian puppies who outsmart Cruella de Vil delighted audiences of all ages. From expressive acting to enthusiastic singing, each student made the story their own.</p><p id="">Visual details also stood out. The costumes, set design, and props were crafted with care and creativity. From spotted T-shirts and puppy ears to Cruella’s signature coat and necklace, every element helped bring the story to life. The show balanced humor and heart, immersing attendees in a whimsical theatrical experience.</p><p id="">Among the standout moments were the musical numbers, including the catchy “Kanine Crunchies” commercial song. Sa’Ni Williams, a fifth grader who played Cruella de Vil, gave a memorable performance with strong stage presence and vocal delivery. “I just tried to project my voice,” said Williams. “It was pretty fun.”</p><p id="">As the curtain closed on the school year’s final production, the Visual Performing Arts program looked ahead with excitement. The success of "101 Dalmatians Kids" reaffirmed the school’s commitment to nurturing student talent through performance opportunities. “It all came together like a well-oiled machine,” said Lyles-Belton. The students' achievement served as a shining example of what is possible when dedication, creativity, and support converge.</p><p id=""><br>Photo Credit to: <strong>Mark Tyler, District Communications Specialist</strong></p><p id="">‍</p>

<p id="">The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School Complex in Atlantic City recently hosted a lively and unforgettable event — MLK Fun Day 2025 — that brought students, staff, and the community together for a full day of celebration, fun, and connection.</p><p id="">Serving both as a reward for students who excelled throughout the year and encouragement for those needing a boost, the day reflected the school’s commitment to both achievement and inclusivity. Principal Jodi Burroughs shared that the main goal was to allow kids to enjoy themselves in a safe and supportive environment.</p><p id="">“The beauty of this is that kids get to be kids and have fun in a safe space,” said Burroughs.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842fb237b3280b2898f7429_503473336_1242607724535644_8320311423337272003_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">Seventh and eighth graders enjoyed a unique treat: access to the newly renovated Pop Lloyd Stadium, where a spirited kickball tournament brought out the best in student teamwork and athletic energy. The stadium buzzed with cheers and laughter as students ran bases, competed with pride, and supported their peers.</p><p id="">Back on school grounds, the school yard was transformed into a vibrant carnival-style playground, complete with inflatable bouncy houses, slides, popcorn, and snow cones. A variety of sports stations gave students the chance to test their skills, while music from a DJ added rhythm and energy to every corner of the event.</p><p id="">Inside the auditorium, creativity and fun took center stage. Students participated in interactive games like Paper Dragon, which challenged them to unroll ribbons using arm circles within 60 seconds, and Dizzy Mummy, where teams of two wrapped each other in toilet paper without breaking it. These games highlighted the students' creativity, agility, and sense of humor.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6842fb2dd392a0f972253dee_503259866_1242607781202305_3949650415119002223_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">A standout element of this event was its cost-free experience for all participants. Thanks to student-led fundraising efforts, including book fairs and popcorn sales held throughout the school year, Fun Day was entirely funded without placing any burden on students or families.</p><p id="">“They pay for nothing, and it’s all because of their fundraising,” said Burroughs. “They did small book fairs, popcorn sales and other things. Fun Day is great because it encourages them to do well.”</p><p id="">With high energy, laughter, and unity, MLK Fun Day 2025 left lasting memories for students and staff alike. It stood as a testament to the school’s dedication to recognizing effort, fostering community, and making space for students to simply be kids.</p><p id=""><br>Photo Credit to: <strong>Mark Tyler, District Communications Specialist</strong></p>

<p id="">Atlantic City has once again captured national attention, this time earning the #3 spot on <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/most-affordable-beach-towns-for-homebuyers-2025/" id=""><strong id="">Realtor.com’s 2025 list of “Most Affordable Beach Towns for Homebuyers.”</strong></a> With its combination of coastal charm, accessible home prices, and a city government deeply invested in revitalization, it’s no surprise Atlantic City is being recognized as one of the best places in the country to live, work, and thrive.</p><p id="">At the 17th Annual Jersey Shorecast, hosted by <a href="https://stockton.edu/light/" id=""><strong id="">Stockton University’s Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality and Tourism (LIGHT)</strong></a>, regional experts discussed what lies ahead for the 2025 summer season.

Scarpa Academic Center</figcaption></figure><p id="">‍</p><p id="">Realtor.com evaluated dozens of coastal destinations nationwide, considering median home prices, inventory levels, and location appeal. Atlantic City rose to the top thanks to its affordable housing stock including single-family homes and condos and its strategic position as both a beach resort and growing year-round city. The report, which evaluated coastal cities based on median home prices and inventory levels, reinforces what residents, investors, and city leaders have long known: you don’t have to be a millionaire to live near the ocean or build a future by it.</p><p id="">This national spotlight underscores what locals already know.

But it’s not just about the ocean views. It’s about quality of life. From beach replenishment projects and newly paved roads to art installations and free family-friendly events, Atlantic City is actively investing in becoming a place where residents can thrive.</p><p id="">The <a href="https://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com/news/atlantic-city-celebrated-small-business-month-with-new-initiatives-including-free-parking-on-may-17" id=""><strong id="">city’s new "Keep it Local" campaign</strong></a> encourages residents and visitors to support small businesses that reflect the city's diverse culture and entrepreneurial energy.

<p id="">For over 25 years, Joe Molineaux has been at the intersection of community and commerce—guiding municipalities and individuals through the challenges and opportunities of launching and growing businesses. Now, as a business development consultant for the City of Atlantic City, Molineaux says he’s never seen conditions more favorable for entrepreneurs than what exists in the city today.</p><p id="">“There’s never been a better time, based on the resources available, the commitment of city leadership, the real estate options, and the current business needs—for someone to start a business in Atlantic City,” said Molineaux.</p><p id="">That optimism isn’t just rhetoric—it’s backed by a groundswell of programs and infrastructure designed to support local entrepreneurs at every stage of their journey.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">A City Committed to Nurturing New Business</strong></h3><p id="">Molineaux recently partnered with the City’s Department of Planning &amp; Development to lead a free “Navigating the Process” seminar at City Hall. The goal? To demystify the first steps of starting a business and connect aspiring entrepreneurs with the tools and people they need to succeed.</p><p id="">The seminar offered real-world insights into:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Why now is the perfect time to launch a business in Atlantic City</li><li id="">Common pitfalls and misconceptions about entrepreneurship</li><li id="">Steps for registering and licensing a new business</li><li id="">How to create a business plan that works</li><li id="">Funding sources and local supports available</li></ul><p id="">According to Molineaux, what makes Atlantic City unique isn’t just the affordability of commercial real estate or the increasing foot traffic from new development—it’s the ecosystem of support.</p><p id="">“From the City’s direct investment in entrepreneurship to the Community Development Corporations (CDCs) located in every ward, Atlantic City is leading the way in creating a nurturing environment for business owners,” he said. “There’s a genuine effort here to move residents forward—not just through business ownership, but through education, mentorship, and support for day-to-day living.”</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">A City on the Move</strong></h3><p id="">Molineaux's message echoes a broader truth felt across Atlantic City: this is a city on the rise, and entrepreneurship is one of its most powerful tools for equitable growth.</p><p id="">Through initiatives like the Small Business Academy, the “How to Do Business with Atlantic City” seminars, and the newly launched Keep It Local campaign, Mayor Marty Small Sr. and the Planning &amp; Development team are making it clear: Atlantic City is not only open for business—it’s investing in it.</p><p id="">This spring, the City also declared May as “Small Business Month”, highlighting the critical role small businesses play in local identity, economic development, and generational opportunity.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Advice for Future Founders</strong></h3><p id="">For those considering a business of their own, Molineaux offers this advice:<br>“Do something every day that moves your dream forward.

<description><![CDATA[The Atlantic City High School girls and boys crew teams delivered a dominant performance at the Atlantic County Crew Championships, capturing the combined team points title and several individual and group victories. The event marked a historic day for the program and highlighted its rising strength.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The Atlantic City High School girls and boys crew teams made an indelible mark on Sunday, May 11, 2025, by winning the combined team points title at the Atlantic County Crew Championships, held at Lake Lenape in Mays Landing. It was a defining moment for a program that had been steadily climbing back to prominence in recent seasons.</p><p id="">The girls team captured the highest points trophy of the meet, a reflection of consistent excellence across multiple events. Coach Sean Duffey praised the squad for their work ethic and dedication. “We put a lot of time in out on the water, and it’s great to see it pay off at the end of the year when it counts,” he said. Duffey called it the most significant day in the school’s history at the Atlantic County races.</p><p id="">A major highlight was the girls varsity eight crew’s commanding victory in the 1,500-meter race, finishing in just 5 minutes, 11.6 seconds. The lineup — Mardiha Ahmed, Katelynn Do, Maggie Morgan, Zuzanna Turska, Anna Tran, Jodi-Lynn Pereira, Lauren Fox, stroke Lexi Gormley, and coxswain Tasnova Tayeba — demonstrated unmatched synchronization and strength, achieving the program’s first-ever win in that event.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1170px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1170px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/682cbbc38cd6a50186f6cda2_492482251_1227523129377437_3727826833055312164_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The day’s success extended beyond a single race. The girls freshman eight clinched a win, signaling that the program’s future remains bright. Meanwhile, the girls varsity second eight added to the medal tally, reinforcing the team’s competitive depth.</p><p id="">Individual prowess also shone through. The girls varsity single sculler brought home a win, showcasing strength and resilience. In another strong performance, the girls varsity quad boat finished first, adding yet another feather to the team's cap.</p><p id="">Not to be outdone, the boys crew team contributed significant victories. The boys second varsity four raced to a win, while the boys novice eight also claimed first place — a testament to the hard work of athletes and coaches alike.</p><p id="">Behind the team’s resurgence was a major investment from the Atlantic City Board of Education, which provided six brand-new Vespoli High Performance Series racing boats, along with new oars and team apparel. The equipment upgrade, revealed in a March 26, 2024 ceremony, helped elevate the program after years of using aging gear.</p><p id="">The new Vespoli boats, with their carbon fiber hulls, wing rigger systems, and custom paintwork, gave ACHS rowers a competitive edge. Coach Duffey noted the significant improvements in both practice and performance. “It was significantly easier to manage practice and races as we were not repairing older, worn-out boats daily,” he said.</p><p id="">This year’s championship victory built on momentum from the previous season, when the girls team won the Junior Eight category at the 2024 Scholastic Rowing Association of America National Championship. With growing numbers, renewed investment, and historic wins under their belt, the ACHS crew teams signaled a powerful comeback and a bright future.</p><p id="">‍</p>

Spearheaded by the Department of Planning &amp; Development, the campaign aimed to drive foot traffic to local establishments and raise awareness of the diverse businesses that make up the city’s commercial landscape.</p><p id="">Businesses across Atlantic City were provided with eye-catching signage in six vibrant colors—each representing one of the city’s six wards. These signs were placed in storefront windows to show support for the ‘Keep it Local’ message. Participating businesses were also featured on the city’s promotional website, <a target="_new" href="http://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com" id="">www.greatdayatlanticcity.com</a>, providing added visibility to both residents and tourists.</p><p id="">To further incentivize public engagement, the city declared FREE CITYWIDE STREET PARKING on Saturday, May 17, 2025. Parking meters and kiosks across the city, with the exception of beach block areas, were not enforced, making it easier for people to visit and shop locally. The initiative was a strategic move to remove barriers to access and encourage greater patronage of Atlantic City’s small businesses.</p><p id="">The city’s efforts extended beyond marketing and convenience. The Small Business Academy, a free educational program offered by the city, concluded its latest cohort this month. Residents participated in business pitch sessions and received training on how to start and grow their own businesses—equipping them with essential tools for success.</p><p id="">Additional free programs such as “How to Do Business with Atlantic City” were also made available to residents, offering guidance on navigating city processes and unlocking opportunities for growth and collaboration.</p><p id="">Another important focus was the revitalization of Atlantic Avenue, where the city continued developing a comprehensive incentive package to attract diverse retail businesses, particularly those not currently represented in the community. These efforts aimed to enhance the avenue’s vibrancy and make it a hub for both residents and visitors.</p><p id="">In collaboration with Community Development Corporations (CDC’s) and the Atlantic City Metropolitan Business and Citizens Association (MBCA), the city worked to amplify the impact of the ‘Keep it Local’ campaign. These organizations provided grants, mentorship, and resources to support aspiring entrepreneurs.</p><p id="">Throughout Small Business Month, Atlantic City underscored its commitment to empowering local businesses through access, visibility, education, and strategic investment. By aligning public initiatives with private-sector goals, the city created a model for community-driven economic development.</p>

]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">The energy at Simpson’s Restaurant on Thursday, May 8th, was undeniable as aspiring entrepreneurs from across Atlantic City stepped up to pitch their business ideas to a panel of judges. These participants had just completed the Small Business Academy, a free, intensive 10-week program designed to empower local residents with the knowledge and resources to launch or expand their own businesses.</p><p id="">The room was filled with excitement, nerves, and hope. Each participant had spent weeks immersed in the fundamentals of business operations, from financial planning and branding to market research and growth strategies. The academy was led by Bruce Weekes and Pam Fields of the City of Atlantic City’s Planning and Development Department, in collaboration with the African American Chamber of Commerce of New Jersey.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6824cd872f27abefb5e8419f_496921618_1007320041582465_6710847756447384099_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><p id="">The pitch competition served as the culmination of everything the participants had learned. Presenters shared their vision in front of a panel made up of local business owners and investors, offering not only feedback but potential support and partnerships. Some participants came in with existing businesses they wanted to scale, while others were presenting a brand-new concept for the first time.</p><p id="">The ideas were as diverse and vibrant as the city itself, ranging from new restaurants to mom-and-pop shops to innovative service-based businesses. No matter the concept, each pitch reflected a shared determination: to contribute something valuable to the local economy and community.</p><p id="">The Small Business Academy wasn’t just about education, it was about empowerment. For many participants, this was their first time standing in a room of professionals and publicly expressing a business vision. The confidence they displayed was a testament to the strength of the program and the support they received along the way.</p><p id="">Mayor Marty Small, Sr., who created the academy several years ago, has long championed initiatives that support local development and economic opportunity. His vision for the academy was simple but impactful: give Atlantic City residents real tools to help them succeed in the competitive world of business.</p><p id="">The evening highlighted how much potential exists when communities invest in their own people. The judges, visibly impressed, offered constructive feedback, mentorship opportunities, and in some cases, real interest in funding or supporting the pitches they heard.</p><p id="">While not every idea may launch tomorrow, the seeds were clearly planted. Participants walked away not only with experience, but with momentum and a network of mentors, peers, and advocates cheering them on.</p><p id="">In the weeks and months ahead, many of these aspiring entrepreneurs will take the next steps in making their ideas a reality. Thanks to the Small Business Academy, they’ll be doing it with knowledge, confidence, and community backing.</p><p id="">The future of Atlantic City’s small business landscape looks brighter than ever, powered by passion, preparation, and people ready to build something great.</p>

<description><![CDATA[The Police Unity Tour made a moving stop in Atlantic City on May 12th, bringing together law enforcement officers and surviving families to honor those who gave their lives in the line of duty. The city stood still as riders arrived in solemn unity and deep respect.
]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">Every year, the Police Unity Tour brings together riders from across the country—men and women in law enforcement, along with survivors of line-of-duty deaths—for one deeply meaningful mission: to honor their fallen colleagues. This year was no different, and on May 12th, at exactly 2:00 PM, the tour made a poignant stop in Atlantic City, drawing the attention and admiration of the community.</p><p id="">The streets were lined with residents and supporters who came out to witness a moment of collective remembrance. What made this gathering powerful was not just the presence of flashing lights or the formation of bicycles rolling in—it was the silent, unspoken connection among the riders and the families they ride for. Every face in the crowd reflected a mix of solemnity, pride, and gratitude.</p><p id="">The Police Unity Tour isn’t just about a bike ride—it’s about carrying a legacy forward. Each participant rides in memory of someone lost too soon, many wearing badges or patches displaying the names of those they honor. As they moved through Atlantic City, you could feel the weight of every mile they had already covered, and the purpose behind every pedal stroke.</p><p id="">After their arrival, the riders were welcomed with a brief but heartfelt ceremony. Speakers from the tour organization, local government, and survivor networks shared words that resonated deeply with everyone present. The message was simple yet powerful: those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty will never be forgotten.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/682354a837fde59dfe78c89d_496798359_1128085936014796_2878241981442932233_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">One of the most touching moments came when families of fallen officers were invited forward. Their stories were short, but each one painted a vivid picture of courage, commitment, and love for service. The crowd stood in respectful silence as names were read, and the memory of each officer was brought to life again through stories, smiles, and even tears.</p><p id="">The event also served a broader purpose beyond remembrance. The Police Unity Tour raises awareness and funds for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and Museum in Washington, D.C., ensuring that these stories are preserved for generations to come. The riders’ dedication to the cause reminded everyone that honoring the past also means educating the future.</p><p id="">Atlantic City has long stood as a symbol of strength and resilience, and hosting the Police Unity Tour only reinforced that spirit. The city's officials, including Mayor Marty Small Sr., extended their gratitude to the participants and emphasized the city’s unwavering support for its public servants and their families.</p><p id="">What lingered after the crowd dispersed wasn’t just the memory of flashing lights and uniforms, but the emotional impact of unity. For many in attendance, especially those who have lost someone in the line of duty, it was a day of healing and connection. It reminded everyone that they are not alone.</p><p id="">As the tour continued on its journey, Atlantic City was left with a deep sense of appreciation and honor. The moment may have passed, but the message remained: service is never forgotten, and sacrifice is always remembered.</p><p id="">The Police Unity Tour left an indelible mark not just on the streets of the city, but on the hearts of all who witnessed it.</p><p id=""><strong>‍</strong></p><p id="">Photo Credit: Atlantic City PBA&nbsp;Local #24</p>

<p id="">The Atlantic City High School American Red Cross Blood Drive made an impressive impact on May 7, 2025, with students coming together to support a life-saving cause. One standout contribution came from junior Derek Santos, who went beyond a standard blood donation by making a Power Red donation, collecting two units of red blood cells in a single appointment.</p><p id="">Derek Santos was inspired by his biomedical science class, where he had been learning the intricacies of drawing blood. Motivated by a challenge from his teacher, he embraced the opportunity, saying, “It’s a cool opportunity. I feel like I did my good deed for the day.” His action exemplified how young people can make a significant difference through small, courageous steps.</p><p id="">A Power Red donation differs from a traditional blood donation by returning platelets, plasma, and saline to the donor after collecting the red blood cells. Although the process took longer, it was twice as effective in terms of impact, making Santos’s donation even more meaningful.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1258px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1258px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/6822240697adaf74ddd0d252_Screenshot%202025-05-13%20003758.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The blood drive was organized by Jaclyn Sarnese and Bryan Scheeler at Atlantic City High School. Jaclyn Sarnese, a biomedical science teacher, emphasized that the students should feel proud of their participation, as their efforts would directly help people in urgent need. Bryan Scheeler, the Red Cross Club advisor, noted that Atlantic City High School traditionally held blood drives each winter and spring.</p><p id="">This year’s spring event surpassed expectations, with students donating more than 30 pints of blood, outdoing the collection from the previous January blood drive. The overwhelming response demonstrated the students' generosity, compassion, and community spirit.</p><p id="">Scheeler also expressed hope that student volunteers would gain valuable insight into the broader work of organizations like the American Red Cross and recognize future opportunities for involvement and service.</p><p id="">The successful event proved that when students are given the right encouragement and opportunities, they can come together to achieve something truly remarkable. Atlantic City High School once again showed that service and education go hand in hand.</p><p id="">The Atlantic City High School American Red Cross Blood Drive served as a shining example of student leadership, volunteerism, and commitment to saving lives.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="">In honor of National Small Business Month, the City of Atlantic City officially celebrated Small Business Month throughout May 2025. Mayor Marty Small Sr. delivered a proclamation affirming the city's commitment to supporting local businesses and boosting the local economy.</p><p id="">The Department of Planning &amp; Development, under the leadership of Assistant Director of Economic Development Bruce Weekes and Principal Community Organizational Specialist Pam Fields, launched a series of initiatives designed to empower small businesses across Atlantic City. Their efforts demonstrated the city’s dedication to creating a thriving environment for entrepreneurs and local commerce.</p><p id="">On May 17, 2025, the city offered Free Parking on May 17, waiving parking fees at meters and kiosks throughout Atlantic City, except on the beach blocks. This initiative encouraged both residents and visitors to explore the city and support neighborhood businesses without the concern of parking fees.</p><p id="">The city also introduced the ‘Keep it Local’ campaign, featuring colorful signage encouraging people to ‘Shop, Eat, Explore’ Atlantic City. Each sign’s color represented one of the city's six wards. Businesses that displayed the signage were featured on the city’s newly launched website — <a target="_new" href="http://www.greatdayatlanticcity.com" id="">www.greatdayatlanticcity.com</a> — further boosting their visibility.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2048px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2048px"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67527a6c8f757cda3e333e95/682211a4458ce6a283377201_495218773_1005167801797689_3494406814623415321_n.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The Small Business Academy continued to provide free education and training for Atlantic City residents interested in launching or expanding their businesses. The latest cohort graduated in May 2025, and participants showcased their business pitches at The Simpson Restaurant and Bar.</p><p id="">In addition to the academy, the city offered other valuable free programs, such as “How to Do Business with Atlantic City,” helping residents understand the processes and resources available to them.</p><p id="">As part of a larger revitalization effort, the city worked on a comprehensive incentive package to encourage new businesses to open along Atlantic Avenue. The goal was to increase vibrancy, attract businesses currently lacking in the area, such as a hardware store — and enhance the overall experience for residents and visitors.</p><p id="">The City of Atlantic City also strengthened community partnerships by collaborating with local Community Development Corporations (CDCs) and the Atlantic City Metropolitan Business and Citizens Association (MBCA). These organizations provides grants and resources to help new businesses get their start, reinforcing the city’s mission to grow a robust, local economy.</p>
